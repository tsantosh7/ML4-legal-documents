","Ground 1: the judge erred in that he failed to give a direction as to the danger of assumptions, myths and stereotypes to assist the jury when assessing the evidence of what was in reality a series of alleged sexual offences. Ground 2: the appellant lost the protection of anonymity which had been afforded to her as an accepted victim of childhood rape, along with the benefit of reporting restrictions. An already vulnerable individual was subjected to extensive media scrutiny in which she was 'vilified', the effect of which may have reinforced to the jury, absent direction, the dangers of assumptions, myths and stereotypes surrounding sexual offences.",That the judge's starting point of 10 years' imprisonment before credit for the guilty plea was too high since it indicated that before reduction for mitigating features the judge's starting position must in fact have been significantly in excess of 10 years. Counsel submitted written advice against overwhelming the appellants culpability. Counselling also submitted that the judge had double counted the tariff time to be served,The two main grounds of appeal consist of a challenge to the admission of the evidence of the prison officer and to the directions of law in relation to joint enterprise. There are two further grounds of appeal (concerning the admission of toxicology evidence and the prejudicial effect of a question posed by the prosecution to the co-defendant.,That the sentence given was too long. It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that it fell within the middle of the range with a starting point of 20 years' custody because some psychological harm was caused falling short of serious and long-term psychological harm.,that the judge failed sufficiently to instruct the jury as to what they were to do with the statements which had been made in open court prior to the co-accused guilty plea,appeals against sentence – the amount of the fine was excessive,All three appellants are lodging an appeal against the duration of the sentences imposed being excessive,Hearsay evidence wrongly adduced,"concerns whether the trial judge was right to allow the case to proceed when evidence gathered by the police in 2002, relevant to the appellant's defence, was destroyed by water damage and was unavailable for the trial","1) that insufficient weight had been given to the appellant's mental health issues when considering his culpability. (2) that the further reduction of one year was entirely insufficient to reflect the appellant's earlier admissions of killing the deceased and furthermore, his early acceptance of guilt of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility. (3) counsel for defence criticise the judge's assessment of the aggravating factors whereby the judge increased the starting point from 15 years to 18 years before factoring mitigation ",Application is made to rely upon fresh evidence of three witnesses,"Based on a psychologists opinion, a timely explanation and admission of guilt for the offence was not forthcoming from the appellant owing to “traumatic history, harsh parenting, PTSD, fear and shock resulting from the killing, lack of trust in others, including professionals, and reliance on his father for advice and support”",That the sentence passed was unduly lenient,"(1) that the prosecution failed to disclose documents in a timely manner. (2) that the police officers investigating the case were corrupt, that they gave unreliable evidence
(3) that CCTV evidence was tampered with in order to corroborate the prosecution case as to the movements of phones between cell sites. (4) that the cell site evidence proved that the applicant was not at the scene of the murder and not in the co-accused vehicle. (5) that evidence relating to items of clothing provided no direct link either to him or to the murder scene. (6) that despite directions given by the judge, the jury would have ignored the true facts and evidence because of the prejudicial evidence given by his co-accused. (7) that although cigarette butts were found near the scene of the murder, from which DNA matching that of the co-accused was recovered, there was no such evidence, and no other evidence, linking the applicant either to the co-accused vehicle or to any of the stolen property. (8) that the applicant's trial was unfair and the resulting convictions unsafe.",That the learned judge did not properly sum up the significance of the joint expert report and without this the jury did not have adequate explanation on how they should deal with this aspect of the case. ,"that the judge failed to have due or any regard to the recommendations made by the defence psychiatrist and the authors of the pre-sentence report for retaining anonymity. Secondly, that he failed to have due or any regard to concerns expressed by both defence and court appointed psychiatrists, and the authors of the pre-sentence report about appellant's increasing paranoia, hypervigilance and anxiety, and the prospect that he might relapse into psychosis. Thirdly, that the judge erred in regarding the lack of any causative link between the paranoid schizophrenia and the offending as a weighty factor in deciding whether to lift the reporting restriction. Ground four is that, in consequence, the judge failed to have sufficient regard to the appellant’s welfare.","The original sentence was excessive with the judge giving insufficient weight to the matters of mitigation, i.e. the appellant's previous good character and years of good work, and insufficient weight to the very difficult personal circumstances which the appellant faced around the time of the offending",That the judge was in error in placing the case into category D; that the judge gave insufficient weight to the aggravating features and too much weight to the mitigating features; and that the judge failed properly to reflect the seriousness of the offence of witness intimidation,"Each of the appellants challenged the safety of the conviction on the basis of the judge's ruling and summing-up. Counsel for the defendants challenge: 

The admitted evidence of a police officer (proffering his expert opinion that the defendant/s comportment on a video is indicative of gang culture). Here, the judge failed properly to direct them as to the uses to which it could be put. In doing so, the judge failed properly to direct the jury as to the uses of the evidence from a police officer. There was a failure of the judge to engage in any discussion about the direction she was going to give on this or any other legal direction, and did not provide any written directions to the jury.
",Counsel for defence argue that the original sentence was excessive in length. The judge started at the wrong sentencing category,"On the basis of: (1) fresh evidence, namely the diagnosis by a consultant forensic, psychiatrist that she was suffering from two previously undiagnosed disorders at the time of the killing and; (2) fresh evidence as to the alleged coercive control by the victim.","The Prosecution application for leave to appeal each of the Judge's rulings (in respect of counts 1, 3 and 4). The Prosecution application was to amend the Particulars to read as follows: 

""Conspired together to defraud [an insurance company] dishonestly by:

i) Failing to disclose to [the insurance company] that they were acting on behalf of those who had been directly involved in the theft through burglary, or who had been directly involved in the dishonest retention of the stolen items.

ii) Causing the reward payment for the return of the stolen items to be increased.
 
 iii) Arranging for a bank account to be made available with [a private business] into which the reward money would ultimately be paid, and;
iv) Having arranged for the reward money to be paid into the bank account of JR, diverted a payment into the account of [the private business] in order to conceal the subsequent disposal of those funds.""
","That offence should be regarded as a case of gross negligence manslaughter and not treated as a case of ""unlawful act"" manslaughter.","Ground 1. Allowing the prosecution to re-open its case after the appellant had given evidence, was an incorrect exercise of the judge. It was unfair because the Crown had been in possession of the footage for some time and had failed to act upon it in an expeditious manner. Ground 2. That the learned judge had failed to identify or adequately identify or properly balance the substantial prejudice occasioned to the defendant, the timing of the identification and introduction of the new evidence.",The length of sentence imposed was manifestly excessive,"Firstly, that the appellant had not owed a duty of care to Ms Brown. Secondly, that there was no reasonably foreseeable risk of death and, in any event, no act or omission of his was a substantial cause of death. As for the alleged negligence, he denied that: (1) he was intoxicated to the extent alleged by the Crown or to a level which led to the accident (2) Ms Brown was obviously intoxicated; (3) the boat was speeding as alleged or at all before the accident; (4) he had been under any obligation to provide or insist on a buoyancy aid being worn by any guest on the boat; (5) the river or weather conditions were such as to have placed the boat at risk or to have contributed to the accident.
The defence counsel contend that the judge should have excluded, wholly or in part, evidence of the answers given by the appellant in his significant witness interview.
",That the judge should not have identified a sentence after trial which was outside the category range for a Category 1 offence,"(i) whether the Jury should have been allowed to continue their deliberations on 27 September, after the second break; (ii) what, if any, further assistance should have been given at that point; and (iii) whether the continuation of the trial to verdicts rendered the process unfair, and the verdicts unsafe?","1. The judge erred in failing to withdraw the charge of murder at the close of the prosecution case. 2. The judge erred in refusing to admit the evidence contained in a joint statement of two experts proffering psychiatric evidence. 3. The judge erred in not giving a propensity direction in relation to the established character of the deceased (victim), as relevant to the issue of the precise circumstances of the killing. 4. The judge erred in failing to give a complete and full direction on loss of control, misapplying the ratio of R v Rejmanski [2017] EWCA Crim 2061. 5. The judge erred in failing to give appropriate safety warnings in his direction on diminished responsibility.",Fresh evidence by way of CCTV footage together with it’s expert analysis undermines the credibility of the eyewitnesses and therefore significantly weakens the prosecution case against the applicant. ,"1. The applicant was incapable of forming the specific intent necessary to commit the offence 
2. Throughout the period of the criminal investigation and prosecution he was affected by a serious, undiagnosed psychotic illness, which adversely affected his engagement with police interviews and his conduct of the defence. 
3. He was unfit to stand trial 
 4. In the absence of evidence of psychiatric illness the jury were presented with an incomplete picture of his mental state which undermines the safety of their findings of mens rea

That there was no evidence to contradict the case advanced in his Second Statement, and at trial, that the appellant did not believe a convicted terrorist was one of the bombers until he was stopped by the police. That the appellant had 'provided the police with the framework around which they subsequently built a case'. That the first Statement had been taken tainted as well as other evidence to which police had been led by its contents.","That the trial judge failed to analyse all of the evidence before concluding they were insufficient to raise the issue of loss of control

That the judge should have taken a more “careful view” of the evidence

That the evidence which had been admitted before the jury in relation to the issue of diminished responsibility was also evidence which should have formed part of the judge's overall analysis before deciding whether to leave loss of control to the jury. ","That the appellant's age and previous good character, the psychological and psychiatric history, and the fact that the appellant struck only a single blow. He submits that the sentence was manifestly excessive. He submits that, in the absence of any other evidence or expert's report, the judge placed undue reliance on the contents of the Victim Personal Statements. He submits that the judge's finding that the victim had suffered psychological harm did not justify her conclusion that, when coupled with the physical injury, the case was one of greater harm",(a) That the Victim Personal Statement (VPS) contained material from which the Recorder concluded that the victim suffered severe psychological harm without any supporting expert evidence; and (b) The VPS was served so late in the proceedings that it was impractical to mount an effective challenge to the material within it. Supporting expert evidence is not necessary.,"that the judge was wrong to find that the appropriate starting point in relation to count 2 was ten years' imprisonment because the offending charged in that count did not result in severe psychological harm and did not involve prolonged detention or amount to a sustained incident; secondly, that the judge was wrong to find that the appropriate starting point in relation to count 2 was ten years' imprisonment because the use of a drug as an aggravating factor was already taken into account in count 1, for which a separate and notionally consecutive sentence was passed; thirdly, that the judge was wrong to find that the appropriate starting point in relation to counts 1, 5, 8 , 10 and 13 was six years' imprisonment, because none of the offending covered by those counts resulted in severe psychological harm, or involved prolonged detention, or was a sustained incident; and lastly, that the consecutive sentences on counts 1 and 2 show that the judge did not pay sufficient regard to totality.","that the judge was in error in passing an extended sentence of eighteen years, which was too high; that he sentenced within the wrong category on count 1; that he wrongly took into account or relied too heavily on the applicant's possession of the boys' trousers when reaching his conclusion as to dangerousness; that he wrongly found the applicant to have acted in abuse of trust; that he wrongly concluded that there was planning or grooming behaviour over an extended period of time; that he placed undue reliance on the VPS of the boys' mother when assessing psychological harm; that he wrongly found psychological harm without any medical evidence; that he wrongly found the applicant to be dangerous; and that he placed too much reliance on the pre-sentence report, which itself adopted a flawed approach to the question of dangerousness.","that there should have been expert evidence on the definition of ""severe""; that in the absence of such evidence the judge wrongly determined the category of the offences by applying his own non-expert medical view and wrongly placed the case into category 1; that he thus arrived at too high a starting point and imposed a total sentence which was manifestly excessive in length.",In appealing the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for public protection counsel for the decent adduces psychiatric evidence that a mental health disposal would be the most appropriate method of dealing with the clients case.,"The judge erred in commenting on the truthfulness of one of the witnesses in relation to his drug use. This comment would have bolstered his credibility in the eyes of the jury and was further reinforced when the judge advised the jury that he was a more credible witness as he was in employment.
The judge's questioning of the applicant undermined his defence of self-defence. The applicant had already addressed the issue of stabbing the deceased in the back during the tussle for the knife and the judge's questioning on the topic was unnecessary.
The judge failed to explain the relevance of the bad character evidence in relation to the prosecution witnesses. The direction that he gave during the summing-up only served to undermine the challenge to the credibility of those witnesses.
The judge erred in directing the jury that, if they accepted certain evidence, ""it blew the defence out of the water"". Counsel for defence contend this evidence was not pivotal to the case and the comment risked usurping the jury's function as the judges of the facts.
The judge failed sufficiently to address the issue immediately above following the defence challenge.
The judge undermined trial counsel in front of the jury by making unfair criticisms of the cross-examination of the co-accused (namely asking the co-accused whether he had any mental health issues) and of his closing speech (as to the failure to take a witness statement, and as to the dangers of racial prejudice). 
The judge erred in refusing the defence application to discharge the jury. The cumulative effect of the judge's various interventions could have left the jury in no doubt as to his view of the credibility of the defence case.","Ground 1.There was no proper evidential basis upon which the jury could reject the unanimous expert psychiatric evidence at trial. Accordingly, and exceptionally, the trial judge should have withdrawn the case from the jury at the close of the evidence. Ground 2.The judge's directions were inadequate","Defence firstly submitted that the recorder (trial) should have excluded victim's VIPER identification of the appellant and that the Recorder's ruling was therefore wrong and resulted in unfairness and injustice. Defence furthered that the misidentification could not be remedied. Secondly, that the recorder should have acceded to the submission of no case to answer. Once the weak identification evidence had been excluded, there was only weak circumstantial evidence.","That the appellant was not capable of taking either child, ""so as to keep [her] out of the lawful control of any person entitled to lawful control of the child. (2) That the judge erred in permitting the Crown to adduce evidence relating to the service and breach of the CAWN and the provision of the actual CAWN to the jury. Such evidence was not probative of the real issues in the proceedings (taking, detaining; removing or keeping). (3) That he fairness of the trial was undermined as the appellant was denied the assistance of an intermediary at trial on the basis that: (i) No ground rules hearing took place; (ii) Special measures recommended by the intermediary were not adopted, (iii) No evidence was admitted that would help the jury to understand the nature of the appellant's communication and learning difficulties, (iv) No time limits were imposed on cross-examination, (v) Cross-examination involved repetitious use of complicated, compound questions.","that the sentences on counts 1 to 6 were unduly lenient insofar: (1) categorisation of the offending fell within a higher category; and secondly, whether, in any event, the judge paid sufficient regard to the aggravating features and the totality of the offending when he arrived at the overall term of eleven years' imprisonment.","(1)  The judge erred in concluding that Code set out by the banks steering committee was clear, (2)  The judge erred in refusing to permit the defence to adduce evidence of extrinsic matters, (3) The judge erred in concluding that the Code was to be ""supplemented"" by Belgian law principles of good faith, (4)  The judge erred in holding that the Libor cases were relevant and that their principles should govern the court's approach in the present case, (5) The judge erred as to the standard of proof to be applied, once he had (correctly) held that Belgian law had to be proved to the criminal standard.",The grounds of appeal are that (1) the judge failed to adequately follow the guidelines; (2) the judge failed to give any reason for the significant increase in sentence for the appellant compared to the sentence imposed on Reason and there was no parity between the sentences; (3) the totality of the offending was not such as to deserve a total sentence of 15 years custody; (4) the judge erred in all the circumstances in finding the appellant to be dangerous.,"(i) The Trial Judge failed to give any, or indeed a complete direction on the meaning of possession of the images, dealing with the mental and physical elements. (ii) The Judge erred in his direction to the jury in respect of Count 1. The jury were left with the clear impression that the Appellant must have viewed this video (Count 1) immediately after receiving the earlier video to which he made a comment about. The danger was that the jury were left with the impression that the video must have been viewed by the defendant. (iii) The Judge erred in his direction to the jury in respect of count 2. The jury were left with the impression as per count 1 above that the defendant was admitting to viewing the material.""",The judge erred in refusing a submission of no case; he erred in failing to appreciate that the quality of the single identification was poor,"That the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive because the judge erred in treating the standard of the appellant's driving as falling not far short of dangerous driving. He submits that the case should have been treated as falling within the second category, ""other cases of careless or inconsiderate driving"". He submits there was no evidence to support the judge's categorisation of the offence.","(i) That the judge was wrong to allow the jury to hear of the appellant's two previous convictions for robbery because he had not created a false impression when giving evidence. Accordingly, there was no legal basis to adduce any of his previous convictions. (ii) Alternatively, if a false impression had been created by the evidence in chief, the judge should have exercised her discretion under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and refused to permit the prosecution to adduce any evidence of previous convictions. Mr Harris argues that the admission of this evidence had such an adverse effect upon the fairness of the appellant's trial that it ought not to have been admitted. (iii) That the jury should not have heard of his conviction on count two, for the reasons already advanced. (iv) The judge (a) erred in allowing the prosecution to change the entire factual basis of its case after having called all its evidence, and (b) should have acceded to the defence submission of no case to answer.",The prosecution case was too weak to justify the admission of the applicant's considerable bad character,"(i) The summing up omitted to include relevant issues of law, contained errors of law and was unfair such as to render the conviction unsafe. Ground (i) divides into three separate issues: (a) The Recorder failed to give a full circumstantial evidence direction; (b) The Recorder wrongly gave an adverse inference direction under s.34 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 when the applicant had provided a prepared statement which made it improper for such a direction to have been given; (c) The Recorder wrongly failed to correct a factual inaccuracy in her summary of the applicant's evidence and dealt with it in such a way as to leave open that his attempted rectification of it was wrong / misleading, thereby diminishing his standing before the jury. (ii) The jury panel was tainted by including a juror who had had contact with one of the officers involved in the search (Oliver-Jacques) whose evidence was disputed and was exacerbated by his being the disclosure officer and officer in the case. (iii) The disclosure process which took place was deficient / incomplete such as to render the trial unfair. (iv) A material witness, Michael Sinclair, about whose evidence there was a dispute, was wrongly allowed to be treated as hostile, and the procedure for treating him as such was carried out wrongly.
",the Recorder at trial: (i) failed to properly assess the agreed evidence in the case; (ii) interpreted a test set out in R v Tsekiri [2017] EWCA Crim 40 too narrowly; and (iii) failed to reject realistic possibilities consistent with innocence.,"First, that the sentence was manifestly excessive because the judge failed to give any credit for the fact that the appellant had been diagnosed with a terminal illness or his exemplary character. Secondly, in the light of fresh evidence (two reports by a neurologist), the sentence of imprisonment should be significantly reduced as an act of mercy.","The defence contends that owing to the appellants personal circumstances and mitigation, relating to her illness, were such that her sentence should have been suspended",The court martial sentencing for an act of negligence should have considered the ‘just culture’ principle in this case that the appellants actions were due to an unintentional lapse from the required standard rather than a deliberate or reckless act. The court martial should have explained why it was considered necessary to impose the given sentence. The defence furthers that the absence of any explicit reference to the just culture principles gives rise to a legitimate inference that the points he advanced in that regard were simply not considered or were given insufficient weight.,"Ground 1. the decision from the trial judge in refusing to discharge the jury, at an early stage of the trial, in the light of the terrorist incident at Westminster Bridge on 22nd March 2017. Ground 2. the decision of the judge, at the conclusion of the prosecution case, refusing to lift the anonymity orders which he had made in relation to the undercover police officers. Ground 3.  the decision of the judge resulting in the discharge of one juror, but not of the jury as a whole, after it had come to light during the summing up that a juror had indicated that she found one of the police officers in the case attractive. Ground 4. The allegation that the judge’s summing up of the evidence given by one of the undercover officers was unbalanced and unfair to the accused.","The trial judge originally imposed a stay on proceedings against the Respondent on the basis that a fair trial would not be possible. Counsel for the respondent subsequently applied that the case be stayed as an abuse of the process of the court. He submitted that there had been a breach of duty by the police leading to the loss of material which might have supported the respondent’s case and, as a result, he could not have a fair trial.",on the issue of the appellant and co-defendant’s joint possession of a revolver and sword,Admission of the appellant’s bad character prejudicing the jury’s mind as to make them sure of his guilt,"Ground 1 the lie about using crack-cocaine - that the evidence should not have been admitted, pursuant to section 101(d); secondly, that if ruled admissible, it should have been excluded as being more prejudicial than probative and as satisfying the test for exclusion; and thirdly, that its prejudicial effect is such as to render the conviction unsafe. Ground 2 The text messages - That no summing-up was capable of removing the prejudice engendered by the text messages and the evidence was not capable of establishing a propensity to use violence and that the circumstances did not provide evidence to show motive",Ground 1. that the appellant was unfit to plead or unable to participate in his trial (at that time). Ground 2. the impact of the appellant's learning disability. Ground 3. The fairness of the trial. Ground 4. medical evidence directed to the (victims) injury,Partial defence of diminished responsibility,the integrity of the trial was fatally compromised by bias on behalf of a juror,A common theme of these appeals has been that the judge applied the wrong guideline and/or that he erred in his approach to the guideline for robbery in a dwelling.,"That the recorder erred in refusing to exclude the evidence of the contents of the BlackBerry. The defence counsel, making reference to Article 6 (of the Convention requires that the trial process must as a whole be fair to the accused), argued any expert instructed by a defendant should have equal treatment with any expert instructed by the prosecution. The defence expert should therefore have equal access to any exhibit and relevant material which is the subject of the prosecution's expert evidence. In a case where reliance is placed upon expert evidence the defence is entitled to understand the methodology used in order to ascertain whether the prosecution's witness had acted in a proper professional manner, and whether his reasoning was sound and his conclusions reliable. In cases where the nature of the process to be undertaken risked destruction of an exhibit, the defence should be informed so that they could make representations about having their own representative present. Where such a risk exists, it is essential for the prosecution's expert to keep a detailed record so that the defence expert can analyse precisely what was done. According to the defence there was an issue as to whether the experts who had decrypted the phone on behalf of the prosecution had done their work properly and reliably. Had defence been given full disclosure as sought, then they would have been in a position to make an abuse of process submission or to challenge the evidence of the prosecution experts. They contended that withholding the evidence on PII grounds placed the appellant at an unfair disadvantage, and that his convictions were therefore unsafe.",the text messages were not dealt with as hearsay evidence and that the jury was not properly directed in relation to them,"the applicant sought to adduce fresh expert evidence from two expert witnesses. Neither of those witnesses were involved in the original trial but both have compiled reports since conviction. As a result of that, it is contended that the applicant's conviction for murder was unsafe because the applicant has autism spectrum disorder (ASD), most likely in the form of Asperger's Syndrome. That condition was not diagnosed at the time of trial and it is contended that had it been diagnosed, the judge would have directed the jury in a materially different way.",The applicant wishes to adduce fresh evidence showing that culpability for the offence was diminished owing to intellectual and cognitive decline in her mental health. She contends that her vulnerable personality and was susceptible to committing the offence under duress.," (1) The Recorder erred in finding that there was sufficient evidence on the issue of identification to allow the jury, properly directed, to return a guilty verdict. (2) The Recorder erred in permitting the jury to draw an adverse inference against the defendant under section 34 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (""the 1994 Act"").","First, the judge erred in placing the offending in Category 1 in the absence of factors indicating higher culpability. The tools and the gloves belonged to the victim and there was no proper analogy with going equipped for theft. Second, in any event, whilst he acknowledges that the appellant has a poor record, he submits that the judge placed too much weight on the previous convictions which did not justify placing the offending within Category 1. Third, even if the offending could properly be categorised as category 1 offending there was nothing to justify a starting point of four-and-a-half years before credit for plea.",The grounds of appeal assert that the judge was wrong to refuse to discharge the jury and that the applicant's convictions were thereby rendered under.,"That the expert opinion concerning the distance at which the appellant mobile connects to the Wifi, indicative of her proximity to her home, was incorrect","The Grounds of Appeal are that the judge erred when stating that he did not find the case of Riding to be particularly helpful.  Rather, it is suggested that the case was of considerable relevance to the issues concerning the approach to the sentence of the appellant, both in terms of the impact of the custodial sentence on the appellant and the approach to the length of the inevitable custodial term.  In addition, it is suggested that it was wrong in principle to judicially determine that the starting point in the appellant's case, comparably with section 51A of the 1968 Act, should be 5 years.  ",The ground of appeal was that the imposition of an IPP was wrong and that the appropriate disposal was a hospital order under section 37 of the MHA coupled with a restriction order under section 41.,The prosecution appeal against the ruling to terminating the indictment of murder ,"1. With reference to previous case laws, that the life sentence imposed was inappropriate.  2. whether there should have been a hospital order rather than an indeterminate sentence because the expert reports all proposed a hospital order. That the post-release regime under a hospital order supervised by medical experts, rather than the probation service, was clearly the appropriate way of dealing with this case",1. One of the juror's sent email communication to the defence alleging there was a failure by some jurors to accept an admitted fact and to follow the judges directions and that they prejudiced the guilt of the applicant from the outset of the hearing. 2. about the judges summing up,"The appellant originally contended that his Article 6 rights under the European Convention had been infringed by the imposition upon him of a reverse burden of proof, and secondly that his defence counsel had failed sufficiently to challenge certain prosecution evidence about the seizing, or the failure to seize, particular notebooks and documents. He subsequently amended his grounds of appeal (abandoning the above) in order to advance the following: “The conviction is unsafe due to the misleading and grossly inaccurate nature of the expert evidence presented to the jury at trial, exacerbated by a lack of preparation by defence counsel.""

","(1) Trial counsel (i) failed to apply to exclude any evidence of or reference to the co-defendant by the victims (ii) failed to avoid co-defendant’s name being referred to as someone the victims had been involved in a dispute with some months earlier. The evidence was irrelevant and inadmissible. (2) Trial counsel failed to prevent the leading of evidence from one of the victims of a description of one of the co-defendants. (3) Trial counsel wrongly adduced in evidence through the officer in the case that the co-defendant had been interviewed under caution and that the CPS had decided there should be no further action taken. This led to re-examination of the officer to establish that another co-defendant was also interviewed about the robbery. (4) Trial counsel failed to advise the appellant properly about discharging the jury following the purported identification of one of the co-defendants. (5) The judge's direction to the jury as to the purported identification of the co-defendant was insufficient to cure the prejudice caused thereby.
",The daughter of the deceased submitted a complaint with regard to the original police investigation of the accident.,On the basis of fresh evidence arising out of the retrial concerning the testimony from from an expert commissioned by the prosecution whose evidence conduct fell far below the standards expected of an expert witness in many different ways. The defence counsel advance that it was wrong for the Serious Fraud Office now to seek to downplay the significance of the expert’s evidence ,"Acting on behalf of the appellant, the defence challenges the admission of, and jury directions in relation to, hearsay, bad character and background evidence.

The second ground of appeal is that the prosecution adduced inadmissible expert evidence from a forensic psychiatrist and coroner","that the judge wrongly refused the application to stop the case at the close of the prosecution case pursuant to the decision in R v Galbraith (1981) 73 Cr.App.R. 124. Secondly, that the judge's summing-up was biased and prejudicial to the applicant in that it wrongly proffered an opinion as to the implausibility of the account.","The effect of that sentence would be to produce a less suitable post-release supervision regime for this appellant, given the risk posed by his illness.",that the applicant was not identified by the victim who identified the other accused.,That there were illogical inconsistencies in verdicts given between counts:  It did not follow from the acquittal on count 2 that the guilty verdict on count 1 was unsafe. The two verdicts cannot stand together,This was a preparatory hearing to consider the admissibility of psychological evidence it terms of whether the evidence was relevant to the question of intent.,Ground 1: The judge should have directed the jury to focus solely on the evidence presented on 11 March. Ground 2: The decision to not to cross-examine the complainant was incompetent or ill-informed,That the original tariff imposed was too lenient,"Where the two psychiatrists agreed that the appellant had a history of mental illness, one psychiatrist was of the opinion that the appellant was experiencing mental health symptoms at the material time of the offence and therefore regarded his culpability as being low. Conversely, the second psychiatrist was of the opinion that his symptoms were not driving his behaviour at the time of the offence and that the appellant was high in culpability. The Judge preferred the evidence of this second psychiatrist and did not provide detailed reasons why. The defence now contend that the second psychiatrist (high culpability opinion) had not seen all the available evidence before forming his opinion and this undermined the quality of the evidence – therefore the trial judge was wrong to prefer the second psychiatrist over the first.",that the trial judge failed to leave to the jury a defence which it is said ought properly to have been left to the jury,The sentence was unduly lenient,"Ground 1. The judge erred in failing to warn the jury about the risk of approaching the evidence in relation to the Applicant's allegation that he was sexually assaulted by B with such preconceptions or assumptions. Ground 2. The judge erred in the manner in which he dealt with the evidence of the Applicant's wife and colleague with regard to what might be described as ""recent complaint"". Ground 3. The judge erred in not telling the jury to consider the truthfulness of the Applicant's version of events in the Applicant's favour.","Ground 1. The misleading nature of the correspondence from the CPS would have misled the defence into thinking there were no records of X making complaints of sexual abuse, that her complaints of physical abuse against her mother were substantiated, that her mental health difficulties were in response to the abusive family situation and there was no evidence that those difficulties had ever given rise to a false allegation of criminal conduct. Ground 2. The failure of the CPS and Ms Briscoe to disclose to the defence relevant material from the child protection team and social services files meant that the defence were prevented from making the necessary inquiries and then obtaining the judge's permission to admit material either by way of admission and/or in the form of cross-examination of the complainant.","That his medical condition is such that, as an act of mercy in the exceptional circumstances of his case, a lesser sentence than would otherwise be appropriate is justified. The argument on his behalf is, in essence, that the applicant's medical condition has markedly deteriorated since he was sentenced, in a manner and to a degree which was not foreseen by the judge below, and that the sentence should therefore be reduced significantly so as to allow for his release either immediately or in the very near future.","Ground 1, that the judge erred in his conclusion that the appellant had given a false impression. As such, counsel for defence contends that the bad character evidence was wrongly admitted before the jury - if the admission of the evidence was wrongful then the conviction was necessarily unsafe despite these directions. The Crown's rebuttal evidence created, she argued, overwhelming prejudice to the appellant. The amount of the bad character material and its nature could not be cured by any direction. If a false impression had been created by the appellant's evidence, the admission of the bad character material went too far to correct that impression.

Ground 2, the evidence submitted by a police officer on gang affiliation did not meet the test for admission as expert evidence and should have been excluded",the difficulties faced by the defence at trial when a decision was made not to call the defence fingerprint analyst and the fresh fingerprint evidence had since become available,"The prohibitions imposed under the Sexual Harm Prevention Order were questioned. There were three matters: (1) Whether any prohibitions on contact were justified? (2) If so, whether contact should be prohibited in respect only of female children rather than all children? (3) Whether any such prohibition should relate to children under the age of 18 or whether the prohibition should be limited to children under the age of 16?","(1) The directions to the jury as to the meaning of reluctant consent and/or reasonable belief in consent were flawed. The judge erred in directing the jury that they had to determine the case on the basis of A's account (she clearly said 'no') or the applicant's account (she was a willing participant). The judge effectively withdrew mistaken but reasonable belief in consent from the jury, whereas it should have been a live issue for the jury to consider. (2) Fresh evidence in the form of Facebook messages are now available that go directly to A's credibility. Edited and misleading copies of the Facebook messages were adduced at trial.
","Against the making of a blanket ban on accessing the internet, which was unrealistic, oppressive and disproportionate","This is an application by the prosecution for leave to appeal that decision on the grounds that the judge had adopted an incorrect approach to the issue of initial disclosure and, in any event, having regard to the issues in the case and all the circumstances, had been wrong to stay the entire prosecution.","(1) That the judge took into account matters that were irrelevant to the consideration of the evidential issues; (2) that the judge failed to take into account the fact that an adjournment would cause no prejudice to the defendant, and: (3) as a consequence, that the judge was wrong to exclude the whole of the telephone evidence.","The submission is that, although the judge was right to pay close attention to the offender's difficulties and disabilities, in that process he failed sufficiently to attend to the seriousness of the offences, their extent, the time over which the two young victims endured them, and the impact of the offences on their lives. Her Majesty's Attorney General regards the sentence previously imposed as being unduly lenient",Whether damaging the window can be made out as an offence of being reckless as to whether life was endangered,"Ground 1: abuse of the process application for the verdict on count 4 (where the defendant was charged with handling the cheques, mail and mobile telephone of the deceased). Ground 2: that the trial should not be conducted under camera. Ground 3: The admission of identification witness evidence, which included: the witness providing less than a positive identification, two technical errors in the conduct of the parade; the selection of pictures being unfair; that when the judge came to sum up the identification evidence he misdescribed it as resemblance evidence and, in doing so, elevated it into a form of identification. Ground 4: That during the judges summing up of the voice recognition evidence he unfairly denigrated one of the defence experts",Owing to the appellant being diagnosed as having a severe mental illness/disorder it was submitted he may have been suffering from abnormality of mind at the material time and therefore his responsibility was substantially diminished,(1) whether the judge was wrong to reject a submission of no case to answer; (2) whether the judge was wrong in not giving a direction to the jury that caution had to be exercised before convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant in the particular circumstances of this case. (3) The principal focus of the appeal against sentence is whether the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for public protection was appropriate and in any event whether the specified term was excessive.,"The first ground of appeal is that the judge was wrong to allow the evidence of the appellant's previous robbery convictions to be adduced before the jury. The second ground of appeal, the defence contend, is that this was not an appropriate case to allow evidence to be adduced; that it was adduced merely to bolster a weak case.","Acting for the appellant the defence appeals against conviction due to the discovery that the complainant had a previous conviction herself. It is contended that adducing that material as bad character could have caused the trial to have taken a different course – the appellant subsequently renewed the application for leave against conviction before deciding to appeal his sentence instead. Here grounds were that the judge passed a sentence at the very top of the bracket for an offence of rape, without making appropriate allowance for the mitigating features that were to be found in the appellant's mental condition and the lack of pre-planning in this offence","Evidence from two experts demonstrating that the first brain injury sustained was more likely to be the result of an accident, rather than shaking, predisposing the victim to risk of a further accidental trauma. The possibility that the deceased had been dropped by the co-; whether what the experts described as the second brain injury was in fact not a separate injury, but a re-bleed (or secondary bleed) from an earlier brain injury. There are two grounds of appeal in respect of which permission has been given and which do not concern the medical evidence. First, it is contended that the judge wrongly admitted evidence from a homeless prevention officer. The second ground concerns the evidence of a cell confession from a serving prisoner, which the appellant submits was wrong of the judge to leave as evidence for the jury to consider","This appeal is concerned with fresh evidence from two experts which, it is contended, casts doubt on the reliability of the conclusion that this appellant unlawfully killed",That there were limitations in the witnesses voice recognition evidence given against him,The appellant sought to adduce fresh expert medical witnesses. In this case recovery demonstrated that the retinal haemorrhages could not be relied upon as evidence of shaking,"Ground 1: The case was not properly summed up by the judge; in essence it was said that the summing up was unbalanced, favouring Kelly Inman as opposed to the appellant, that the appellant's defence was not put properly to the jury and the medical evidence was not correctly summed up. Indeed, the judge had shown the appearance of bias against the appellant throughout the proceedings. Ground 2: The conviction was not safe as in judgments given before and after the trial before the judge, another judge from the Family Division of the High Court, had concluded in family proceedings that the co-defendant (the appellants partner) was an untruthful witness who manipulated her evidence; as her evidence was central to the case against the appellant, the conviction could not be safe. The appellant also sought leave to appeal on an additional ground, namely the failure by the judge to direct the jury correctly on intent.",Ground 1. Subsequent forensic examination of Landslide's computer records showed that the appellant was the victim of identity theft; that the computer records on which the prosecution relied were rife with fraud; that the specific subscriptions said to have been taken out by the appellant were contaminated with fraud. Ground 2. The jury had been presented with a misleading and prejudicial account about the nature of Landslide and its website. They were told that Landslide advertised itself as a gateway to child pornography and that it denied access to anyone who did not specifically confirm that they wanted to view child pornography. This caused such prejudice to the appellant that he did not have a fair trial and his conviction is unsafe.,Ground 1: that the judge was wrong to admit the evidence of bad character; Ground 2: that by the close of the Crown's case the proceedings had become fundamentally unfair with an abuse of the process and therefore ought to have been stayed; Ground 3: that the judge made a number of errors in his summing up,"Acting on the appellants behalf the defence asks the court to consider fresh psychiatric evidence about a key prosecution witness, which he submits ought to have been adduced on the appellant's behalf at the trial which might have made a difference to the jury's verdicts","Ground 1. That the conviction for murder (rather than manslaughter) was arguably unsafe on the basis that the evidence was insufficient to prove the necessary intent
Ground 2. That the jury ""should have had the opportunity to hear the alternative scientific arguments and then decide whether the prosecution case had been made to the appropriate standard"". Consequently, the failure to call another medical expert, who evidence was withdrawn from the original trial proceedings, was likely to have given the jury the wrong impression that there were no challenges the defence could have made to the Crown's expert evidence.",The Criminal Cases Review Commission referred this case to the appellant court for a review because they were concerned about the standing of one of the pathologists who gave evidence at the original trial. The pathologist in question faced charges in relation to several other cases where he was found to have given unreliable and over-dogmatic evidence leading the tribunal to question the accuracy of his conclusions and to doubt the overall objectivity of his testimony.,"Based on the reports from the appellants expert adverting various issues with the DNA evidence, his counsel adduced that it was unreliable and made an application that the DNA evidence should be excluded. The single ground for appeal was that the judge wrongly ruled that the DNA evidence from [the FSS expert] was sufficiently reliable to be admitted in evidence. It was contended that the judge should have approached the matter objectively and given full reasons as to his independent objective view that the evidence was reliable, rather than simply accepting the subjective opinion of the FSS experts. Three issues arose on the appeal: (1) Was the ruling of the judge on the admissibility correct? (2) should the judge have made an order for a preparatory hearing? (3) What is the proper approach to dealing with the issues of admissibility raised?","Ground 1. Since the appellants original trial, there have been changes in the Forensic Science Service's guidelines for presenting and interpreting evidence on the recovery of Gunshot residue which, counsel for the defence contend, render the evidence given by the forensic scientist at trial as being inaccurate or misleading causing the convictions to be unsafe. Ground 2. Where the appellant has no previous convictions, the defence contends that the trial judge did not direct the jury to take the appellant’s good character into account. Ground 3. It was submitted by the defence that the judge may have inadvertently given the jury the impression that a mobile phone associated with the crime belonged to the appellant. Ground 4. Hostile witness direction. The defence assert that judge should have given the jury an explicit direction that, had they concluded that the witnesses oral evidence was true or may have been true then it should be treated as a significant weakening of the prosecution case.
","(a) The judge failed to give the jury a series of necessary directions designed to ensure a fair trial; (b) the judge failed to put the defence case properly to the jury as to the facts; (c) the case required clear and tailored directions on character evidence, cross-admissibility and collusion, but no such directions were given; and (d) the judge was wrong to leave counts 24 and 25 to the jury and, having left them to the jury, he failed to give the jury adequate directions in relation to those counts.",Ground 1: The manner in which the judge withdrew from the jury the issue of the necessary intent for murder. Ground 2: The refusal of the trial judge to leave the issue of provocation to the jury. Ground 3 concerns the issue of expert evidence. It is submitted that the judge was wrong to exclude the evidence of an expert whom the defence wanted to call in particular to explain why the appellant's cultural background was such that she might have lied to the police when first interviewed and why she later failed to say what she was to say at her trial.,a fair trial not being possible on the ground that undue delay had created incurable prejudice in an examination of the respondent's case,‘the conviction is not safe to the extent to which the jury could have reached the conclusion that they were sure that the appellant was the robber on the basis of the evidence of the photographs and footage’.,"(1) the evidence of the complainant was so discredited that it was not safe for the case to go to the jury, (2) other inconsistencies in the evidence, and (3) the judge misdirected the jury as to how they should approach the two counts","Ground one: nothing in the expert evidence which could lead a jury, properly directed, reasonably to find that the appellant had participated in the violent disorder, and that the judge should have withdrawn the case at the close of the prosecution evidence. Ground two: the judge should not have given a direction to the jury under section 34 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994",The first two trials had proceeded to and ended with a jury disagreement after the appropriate majority verdict was given. this third trial constituted an abuse of process or an unfair trial because of a number of specific additional features in the forensic process.,"it is not acceptable for a conviction, very heavily dependent on the evidence of a child as young as 4½ years, describing events said to have occurred when she was not yet 3 years old, to be regarded as safe: more formally, the competency requirement was not satisfied.",Appeal based on fresh medical evidence,Whether the appellants confessions could be safely relied upon as proof of what she said she had done (the offence). Counsel for defence contend that evidence from two new experts shows that the conviction is unsafe,"That the judge should not have permitted cross-examination and, having done so, failed to give adequate directions to the jury concerning the outcome","That it was too late for the prosecution to make the point that CCTV footage along with other evidence showed the appellant being involved in attacking the victim. Additionally, that the judge was wrong not to adjourn/discharge the jury pending the obtaining of an expert report.",The three dogs in question had not been the subject of a conviction for the aggravated offence and that the dogs do not constitute a danger to the public if properly restrained by responsible adult when in a public place.,"whether the judge should have excluded the DNA evidence 
whether the jury should have been directed to disregard the DNA 
The judges refusal to discharge a juror on the ground of apparent bias",In reference to sentencing guidelines the original sentence imposed was too long,That the appellant had an abnormality of mind at the time of the offence,The possibilities of DNA being transferred and the ability of experts evaluating this - the evidence should not have been admitted,that the Crown's expert was incompetent to give evidence and/or biased so that his evidence should not have been received.,"Ground 1: criticisms are made of the failure properly to assess and examine the three complainants psychologically before the ABE interviews were carried out. Ground 2: the evidence having emerged as it did the case should have been withdrawn from the jury either at the end of the prosecution case or of the judge's own motion, at the end of the evidence as a whole as being either non – existent or so weak and tenuous that no jury could properly convict. Ground 3: the summing up failed to direct the jury properly as to the care to which they should look at the complainants' evidence and that it was an unbalanced summary of the evidence, omitting many points favourable to the appellant.",New and compelling evidence surfacing. Para 3 The basis of the application was that a re-examination in 2008 of boots admitted to be those of the respondent had revealed a spot of blood where the match probability upon DNA analysis was 1 billion to 1 that the blood was that of the deceased. It was therefore accepted on behalf of the respondent for the purposes of the application that the blood was that of the deceased. It was further accepted for the purposes of the application that the blood had been deposited when wet.,Evidence of bad character should not have been admitted by the judge in the original trial,"Mr. Robinson's grounds: that he was recruited as a driver and not involved in the specific planning of the robbery – his defence argues that he was not aware that a firearm was going to be used. Mr Jordan’s grounds: that he had not encouraged any the exceedingly dangerous driving that his co-defendant, Robinson, had engaged in when endeavouring to secure their escape",1. The judge should not have granted anonymity Order to the witnesses. 2. The judge should have warned the jury as to the disadvantages caused to the Appellant's case by the grant of the anonymity orders. 3. The judge should have warned the jury to approach with care the evidence of the co-defendants adverse to the Appellant.

The forensic investigator called for defence gave evidence in relation to the call data records. In his survey, none of cell sites provided service at an address associated with the appellant – his results therefore differ from those given in unchallenged evidence by the prosecution's expert witness at trial. The expert went on to suggest that the relevant network provider be asked whether any network configuration changes had been made during the intervening years which might explain the differing results.",99,99,2,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,Add text,Add text,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,,99,99,99,99,,,,,,,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,The distance at which a phone could connect to Wifi router,,,99,,,the number and characterisation of the relevant indecent images,,,99,99,,,,,,99,,,99,99,99,99,99,99,There were disagreements between the experts in regards to: (1) the print ridges and furrows - what lines were the ridges and what lines were the furrows on the print or prints left on the door handle; (2) double touch - whether there had been one touch leaving a print or two touches leaving two prints; (3) clarity of the left side: whether the area to the far left was sufficiently clear so that reliance could be placed on it.,99,99,99,99,99,99,,,99,,,,,,,,,,,,99,,,,,99,,,,,,,99,99,,,,,,,,99,,,,,

Q59b. The prosecution’s initial contention was that the applicant's DNA could have been transferred to the air bag in three ways, and that the expert evidence did not prefer one way over another. Following analysis however, the sample taken from the airbag indicated a mixed DNA profile. There was no evidence as to how the applicant's DNA was deposited on the air bag or the order in which it was deposited as against other contributors to the profile. The DNA originated from at least three other unidentified people was present in the result from the airbag. The statistical calculation provided addresses only the possible donors of the DNA and does not consider the mechanism, either direct (such as physical contact with the airbag) or indirect (such as the airbag coming into contact with DNA already on the driver's seat or airborne such saliva being deposited by talking), by which any DNA was deposited nor the time at which it may have been deposited. Nor do these calculations assist in attributing DNA to a body fluid.

Q59b. Two of the exhibits (including a potential murder weapon) were examined by experts for the defence who were able to make notes and take photographs of them prior to them being lost. It is noted in Para 30 that the forensic scientists who were asked to give evidence at the second trial would have preferred to examine the exhibits for themselves. The defence argue that one of the exhibits in particular was of probative value since it potentially exculpatory evidence for their client. The defence argue that they were deprived of being able to collect DNA samples from the exhibit which could have exonerated the appellant because analysis would have revealed traces of DNA from someone else that they suspect perpetrated the crime.

Expert 13 - Reported as being a retired Consultant Physiologist. Of this expert, counsel for the prosecution challenged his expertise. However, the courts concluded that he did have relevant experience. His background is as a medical practitioner with early experience (in the 1960s) of neo-natology, including neonatal intensive practice. Much of this experience was in the United States, but in 1968 he returned to England as a research officer in peri-natal physiology based at Oxford University. Between 1981–2005, he held a consultancy at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in Oxford University, where he set up and ran the ""Maternal Infant Healthcare and Telemonitoring Research Centre"" at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford. At para 67 it was noted that the expert proffered that he could offer expertise as to the causes/potential causes of damage sustained to the deceased’s brain. However, the courts remarked that although he puts himself forward as an expert in that particular area of expertise he does not even suggest that he is an expert on the causes of subdural haemorrhage. It was the courts judgment, that he was wise to disclaim such expertise in oral evidence: it was not a disclaimer he had entered at the time of any of his written reports, or indeed before giving evidence. The court subsequent stipulated that he was a “most unsatisfactory witness”. His reports were “diffuse, poorly sourced where they are sourced, hard to interpret, infused by arrogance, and quite unnecessarily combative and dismissive of other experts, including those in fields which are not his own. In order to understand what he was contending, it was necessary for us to ask him to summarise his essential thesis on two sides of A4. Discounting his definition of terms, he did so.” Expert 14 – Professor of clinical pathology

Q90b. The defence expert commented on the legal merits or otherwise, as he perceived them to be, of the case against the appellant. He said for example, that in his opinion the Crown's case did not meet the burden of proof in relation to the counts on the Indictment; he said there was ""no evidence"" on the issue of possession; he said that one image was not indecent or unlawful in his understanding and experience and he said that ""although it is not an area on which expert evidence can be given"" he ""would describe most of the images in Counts 3-16 as marginal in terms of lawful/unlawful age"".

Q90b. Feedback from the DC providing evidence, adduced by the crown, was that a video found in a vault application on the phone ( storage area) was protected by a password. Although it had been downloaded - it was not possible to say if or when it had been viewed. The defence counsel’s expert indicated that he had seen a video several times before on other mobile phones, that it was “indecent from the start and very distinctive. There is no mistaking its content”. He verified that all six videos were present on the first download but only Counts 1 and 2 videos remained on the second download but as an expert he said it is not possible to say when the deletions had taken place.

Q90b. The second prosecution digital expert said a person would not be able to tell just by looking at the handset that there was a sophisticated security package on it. It was only when trying to use the phone that a person would realise he or she was locked out. He also said the work he had done that it was a very delicate process and there was a risk that the chip would be damaged and data lost in the course of carrying it out.

Q90b. The fingerprint analyst gave evidence that the fingerprint identified on the wrapping  was the appellant's and the print found was described in some detail “The wrapping consisted of strips of brown packaging tape over a yellow electrical tape. The fingerprint was found just below the label on the yellow tape and was a left ring finger in a vertical position. The electrical tape had been used in a number of places and the piece of tape with the fingerprint on was 20 cms in length and about a third of the way down. There was a single print, but it was a good quality print. It was unusual for drugs to be packaged using electrical tape but he had seen it before.” It was also reported that ‘The fingerprint overlapped part of another part of the packaging with a print which could not be identified, but the print had been left with the left ring fingerprint and the appellant was right handed. Therefore, [prosecution] submits, it suggested a pressing down as part of a packaging.’

Q90b. The expert evidence went on to explain that the DNA could have resulted from direct transfer from the appellant or secondary transfer. It was not possible to say when the DNA was transferred to a particular surface, or for how long the DNA had been present on the surface. There was no expert evidence on the blood transfer. The evidence was that the blood could be transferred if wet, if dry, or if dried blood had become really animated because it had become wet.

Q90b. As a result of the defence expert’s work, and her correspondence with the prosecution expert, the number of indecent images alleged by the prosecution was very substantially reduced. The defence expert had challenged the prosecution expert's work, saying that he had substantially over-counted the number of indecent images, and having been provided with her report, the prosecution expert agreed that he had been ""overzealous"" in his work. He then accepted the defence expert's views “very readily”.

Annotations: A recorded interview from the appellants wife / mother of the deceased on an injury sustained to the baby was deemed hearsay and not accepted by the crown as being truthful or accurate. The courts asserted that had the defence wished to put that demonstration forward as an accurate representation of what had happened, so as to provide a basis for an expert witness to opine on issues in the case, a hearsay application would have been necessary. Given that Donna could have been called to give the evidence herself, we see no basis on which it could be argued that such a hearsay application could have succeeded.","99

Annotations: This was central to the ground of appeal for this case. Counsel for defence contended that the judge erred in his conclusion that the appellant had given a false impression. As such, counsel for defence contends that the bad character evidence was wrongly admitted before the jury - if the admission of the evidence was wrongful then the conviction was necessarily unsafe despite these directions. The Crown's rebuttal evidence created, she argued, overwhelming prejudice to the appellant. The amount of the bad character material and its nature could not be cured by any direction. If a false impression had been created by the appellant's evidence, the admission of the bad character material went too far to correct that impression.","2

Annotations: One of the forensic psychiatrists identified social factors contributing to the appellants diagnosis of a personality disorder, i.e. abusive childhood with a collusive mother, inconsistent parenting, consequent difficulty in establishing relationships, losses and estrangements in adulthood, drink and drugs dependency and low self-esteem. Her history of lying. Assessments undertaken in prison highlighted dispositions consistent with the diagnosis of a personality disorder, history of bullying and psychological assessments suggestive of her being 'over-assertive'. One of the experts also gave testimony that the same personality giving rise to an increased risk of false confessions also produces an increased risk of aggression, of callousness and of violence, all of which make the defendant vulnerable to a sudden loss of temper in the course of which she may have smothered her Grandmother.

Aspects of the defendant’s history was also highlighted, i.e. previous conviction and imprisonment for arson, admissions that she committed an offence in order to claim benefit money, she initially blamed her son but latter admitted the offence under duress from the police otherwise her son would be taken into care – supporting her inclination for making false confessions; non-accidential injuries to her son and poor treatment of him; her history of making false statements.","1

This had led to an application under s. 8 of the Criminal Procedure Investigations Act 1996 (""the 1996 Act"") for disclosure of the download of  phone in which, as part of the application, questions had been posed about the failure of the police to seize and interrogate complainant’s phone.","2

He also said he would make no further order in relation to the production of a joint report.",99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,2,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,"It was at the judges discretion whether or not to admit the mobile phone evidence after the close of the prosecution case. The appeal court stipulated that had the judge discharged the jury, the material would have emerged at any retrial and the fact that the defendant had only then admitted multiple stabbings after having seen this new evidence would equally have been relevant (and admissible) in connection with the charge of attempted murder. Therefore, there was no reason why the trial should not proceed. Whether there was sufficient prejudice to the defendant to justify rejecting the evidence or discharging the jury was eminently for the judge. He analysed the position accurately and with care. ",99,99,99,99,99,99,99,Add text,Add text,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,,"The judge canvassed: The judge amplified that matter in the following terms: ""To establish either of the two statutory defences available to him the defendant has to prove, more likely than not: (1) That he had not himself seen the video and did not know, nor had any cause to suspect, it to be indecent or (2)(a) That the image was sent to him without any prior request made by him and (2)(b) That he did not keep it on his phone for an unreasonable length of time. Both limbs must be proved for the second statutory defence to succeed.""",99,99,99,,,,,,,"The judge said that one of the undercover officer’s DNA and/or fingerprints were found on any item from the bag, “[the officer’s] evidence is such that he either might have touched the bag and its contents on the course of examining and/or moving them, likewise, he may have shed DNA on them simply by being in the near vicinity of them”.  ",99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,"In open court the recorder gave his ruling. Although the recording of his ruling is incomplete, the recorder was later able to provide a draft note of what he said. The note shows that he concluded in these terms: ""I do not consider that the admitting of the evidence of the prosecution will have an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings. Nor do I find that the prosecution have, in the context of the issue being raised in this case, failed to disclose all that they need to.""","... you decide this case only on the evidence which is being placed before you, in other words the admissions, the evidence of the fingerprint expert and the defendant. There will be no more evidence. Do not speculate about what evidence there might have been, or allow yourself to be drawn into speculation. After all, the defendant knows perfectly well, he says, who sent the text messages because he was the man, he calls him his mate, who he was in the drugs business with and they were very close. Perhaps not surprisingly he has not come to court to give evidence but let us not worry about it, about witnesses there might have been, just deal with the evidence you have got, okay.",99,99,"In our judgment the Recorder was not wrong to dismiss the submission of no case to answer…. First, this is not a case where the DNA evidence was the only evidence that the appellant was the assailant. There was the identification evidence of the assailant's appearance. The discrepancy in the evidence in relation to height is not sufficient to exclude the appellant as being the assailant. Secondly, the appellant maintains that here there was a movable item, namely the assailant's gloves, being an item left at the scene of the crime. However, the relevant DNA was not found on those gloves, rather it was found on (a) the wall (plainly not a movable item) and (b) the lanyard, again hardly an item left at the scene of the crime - but rather an item worn by one of the victims of the assault. Moreover, even on the appellant's theory of the DNA transfer the DNA (on the wall and on the lanyard) had been deposited in the course of the commission of the crime ""by the assailant"" and not some other point in time or other location.",99,99,"The recorder, whilst reminding the jury that the evidence about 25 metres was agreed, also directed the jury to consider her account that the expert evidence must be wrong.",,,99,,,"""In relation to these offences, the prosecution must make you sure of the following three things: firstly, between 1 September 2006 and 16 January 2012, the defendant made photographs; secondly, those photographs were of children; and thirdly, the photographs were indecent. In this case there is no dispute about any of those elements of the offence. It is admitted that the defendant downloaded a number of the images and that there were indecent images of children... As a matter of law, downloading images onto a computer falls within the definition of 'making those images'. It is not simply taking photographs. If you download an image, you make it as a matter of law. You will have no difficulty in finding the prosecution has proved the three elements, and you can be sure of it because it is not disputed. You then move on to the second part, what the defendant must prove and to what standard. That relates to the defendant's defence and is the main issue in relation to these counts.""",,,,99,,,,,,99,,,99,99,99,99,99,99,"In his summing up to the jury the judge emphasised that the jury should assess the evidence and not try to be amateur experts. He directed them that if they found that the evidence of Mr G, supported by Mr M and Mrs W (all commissioned by prosecution), accurate and reliable, then they were entitled to come to the conclusion that the fingerprint was that of the appellant; if in view of the evidence of Mr B (defence) they concluded that the evidence called by the Crown was not or might not be reliable, then they should discard it and ignore it",99,99,99,"The judge concluded, having heard from experts for the prosecution and the defence, that the dataset provided on 8 September 2014 had defects in it which were substantially those relied on by the respondents. The judge said: The dataset is […] not 'fit for purpose' in the respects in which Mr. Sebesta explained his view. That is, the functionality of the search process is compromised resulting in wholly inaccurate and in many instances perverse results and also that the product of the search process is inherently unreliable and incomplete. Whilst I would not go as far as to say that the dataset is 'wholly' unusable, it does not represent a dataset which, in my judgement, would allow proper and efficient searching and analysis of the dataset to take place. Equally of importance is Mr Sebesta's conclusion that the dataset lacks forensic integrity. The difficulties explained above, in particular with missing or corrupt metadata, mean that the export of data from FTK to Relativity deprived the dataset of that essential forensic integrity.

116,NOTES – PLEASE WRITE ANYTHING THAT YOU THINK IS IMPORTANT BUT WHICH IS NOT CODED ABOVE. THIS MAY INCLUDE QUOTES.,"The appellant was found guilty of accessing unlawful websites. He subsequently claimed Malware was responsible. However, his defence expert could find no malware on this computer. Where no malware was found the appellants former lawyer, from the trial, advised him that this attenuated his case and it was recommended that he pleaded guilt albeit to lesser charges. Problems with expert evidence: Where the trial court had made directions for a joint report between the prosecution and defence expert that would, reportedly, be easy for the jury to understand this was not possible. The experts could not agree however on the content of a joint report, and one was not produced either by the date directed by the judge. The report drafted by the defence expert was too long and did not fulfil the criteria as instructed by the court. It was reported that in an email (para 29) to the prosecution expert, that the defence expert understood was the court had requested albeit the draft produced did not reflect this. It was furthered that “had this matter gone to trial, in our opinion the draft, which was complicated as well as lengthy, and which failed to boil down the issues in a suitable or comprehensible way, would have been of little assistance to the judge, let alone the jury.” The courts expressed a further concern about the defence expert straying from his remit of expertise into legal matters. At para 30, the court remarked “It has been well-recognised for many years that in the criminal jurisdiction, just as in civil litigation, it is central to the role of the expert, that he or she should provide independent, objective, unbiased opinion evidence in relation to matters within his or her expertise; and that he or she should never assume the role of advocate”. Reference was made to Criminal Procedure Rules, Part 19, in particular, para 19.2 which sets out the expert's duties to the court. Commenting on the defence experts report, the court judged that the report had not “confining itself, as it should have done, to matters within the proper purview of his expertise; in parts, it seemed to argue the appellant's case and ""descend into the arena”. Thus the courts opined that “This failure to deal with evidence, which if true, was potentially disadvantageous to the appellant's case, served to reinforce the unfortunate impression given that the report, and therefore its author, was not objective.” Para 47. The court highlighted that they had been “told from the outset that Mr Campbell was a true expert in his field and his evidence had been relied upon across the country and had caused the Crown in other areas on more than one occasion to discontinue similar proceedings”.

","Para 98. The court expressed concerns about some of the content within a psychiatrist’s report that seemed to us to stray beyond his area of expertise, which was described may have “betrayed a degree of a lack of objectivity”. The court furthered that “having heard all the evidence, having seen and heard from the appellant herself, he was in our view best placed to assess her level of culpability. He was also right, in our view, to assess the appellant's offending as even more serious than that considered in previous decisions of this Court in cases of this kind”.

","Para 35. The forensic analysis of the appellants blood sample was called into question by the defence. The defence submitted at trial that such evidence was inadmissible: although the blood sample had been properly requested and provided, it was used not for the stated purpose of ascertaining whether the appellant was involved in the offences for which she had been arrested, but to assist in determining her state of mind at the time of the offences. In those circumstances, it was submitted that the evidence should be excluded on the basis that its probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect.","

","Para 36. Observation by Bar not Bench: proposition in law that anything said by one defendant in the absence of another defendant could not count as evidence against that other defendant.  ""Now, as I explained at paragraph 11, there is no direct evidence here that Mr Baines committed the crime that he is charged with. There is no evidence from an eyewitness saying they saw him do it and there is no evidence that he confessed to the crime so what the Prosecution rely on is what is sometimes referred to as circumstantial evidence.""
","There had been serious and systemic failures within the organisation to address grave Health and Safety risks.

Principal Issues: Especially having regard to the wide-ranging attack launched by Faltec against the sentencing observations, it is necessary to underline the appellate role of this Court. Our task is not to re-run the hearing before the Judge – a hearing during which he heard days of evidence. Instead, we are concerned with whether it has been shown that the Judge was wrong and, if so, whether any such error/s demonstrated that the sentence passed was wrong in principle or manifestly excessive.

The appellant company has a history of failing to ensure health and safety of its employee and were previously directed to review its standards and systems. The appellant was criticised for not taking the necessary actions to train anyone with a view to giving that person the status or expertise to countermand the suggestions of an apparently experienced subcontractor. 

Referring to case law (R v Squibb) on the issue of harm and its seriousness, the courts stated that it was a scientific question which should be answered, if possible with the assistance of scientific evidence.

There was discussion before the court on the characterisation on the likelihood,  based on statistical evidence, of harm occurring. The courts subsequently discerned categories of harm (1, 2, low to high etc). Elevation of category was by reason of injuries being sustained. This elevation of risk was commensurate with the fine to be imposed    ","There were three appellants in this particular case. All were family members. Mother and two sons. The appeals against the duration of the sentence, being excessively high, was quashed for the mother, whilst the appeals for her two sons were dismissed. 
Para 9. A mobile phone recovered from a crime scene was found to have the appellants DNA. Para 12. A sub-machine gun was found to have a mixture of DNA from at least two individuals and the scientists concluded that one of the defendants could also have contributed to some of the DNA","Central to this case is the long-established principle of the English common law that a defendant in a criminal trial is entitled to see and know the identity of his accusers. Consequently, counsel for the appellant contended that hearsay evidence based on an unavailable witness was inadmissible. There was mention of DNA evidence but no exposition.

","This was a case where counsel for defence contested the conviction for murder on the grounds that their client was suffering from a mental illness and that rather he was guilty of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility (lowering his culpability). The defence experts (three psychiatrists) were of the opinion that the appellant suffered from a psychotic illness, whereas the prosecution expert (a psychiatrist) rejected their suggestion and opined that it was more likely that the appellant's behaviour at the time was due to personality structure, interacting with voluntary intoxication. The judge (para 19) upon reviewing the psychiatric evidence stated his own conclusion the appellant was not suffering from either schizophrenia or from a schizoaffective disorder at the time of the murder: ""I find ... his behaviour was as a result of anti-social personality traits, coupled with his anger and stress and possibly exacerbated by cannabis and alcohol consumption ...""","Para 19. Reference made to how the Court of Appeal shall, in considering whether to receive any evidence, have regard in particular to—(a) whether the evidence appears to the Court to be capable of belief; (b) whether it appears to the Court that the evidence may afford any ground for allowing the appeal; (c) whether the evidence would have been admissible in the proceedings from which the appeal lies on an issue which is the subject of the appeal; and (d) whether there is a reasonable explanation for the failure to adduce the evidence in those proceedings. Para 9. Fingerprint evidence was indicated albeit with no explication. Para 36. The defence advances that an interview transcript had been improperly edited so as to exclude important content to the extent that it was deemed unreliable. Para 22. Noting that his results therefore differ from those given in unchallenged evidence by the prosecution's expert witness at trial, the forensic investigator suggested that the relevant network provider be asked whether any network configuration changes had been made during the intervening years which might explain the differing results. Counsel for defence opined that Vodafone would be willing to provide the information sought but only if required to do so by a court order. Consequently, one of the applications made to the court was for such an order against Vodafone.","Para 37. The prosecution expert (professor) psychologist did not significantly depart from the defence expert psychologists opinions on the appellants background. However, she did not agree with the conclusion that his traumatic history, harsh parenting, PTSD, fear and shock resulting from the killing, lack of trust in others, including professionals, and reliance on his father for advice and support provided a reasonable explanation as to his denial of the stabbing and delayed admission.

",Para 29. The prosecution witness (reported as someone who deals with matters related to cell siting) provided testimony on chronological movements of a mobile phone. Para 32. Counsel for the prosecution submitted that the evidence from the defence expert on the CCTV footage was wrongly placed the time at which the co-accused vehicle was sited.,"Para 7/8: a joint statement pursuant to a direction given under rule 19.6 of the Criminal Procedural Rules. That rule is in the following terms: (1) This rule applies where more than one party wants to introduce expert evidence. (2) The court may direct the experts to— (a) discuss the expert issues in the proceedings; and (b) prepare a statement for the court of the matters on which they agree and disagree, giving their reasons. (3) Except for that statement, the content of that discussion must not be referred to without the court's permission. (4) A party may not introduce expert evidence without the court's permission if the expert has not complied with a direction under this rule."" The relevant provision in the Criminal Practice Direction Part 19 paragraph 19C.2 makes clear that: ""The purpose of discussions between experts is to agree and narrow issues and in particular to identify: (a) the extent of the agreement between them; (b) the points of and short reasons for any disagreement; (c) action, if any, which may be taken to resolve any outstanding points of disagreement; and (d) any further material issues not raised and the extent to which these issues are agreed."" Para 10. There was a conflict of opinion between the experts about the time interval between the deceased consumption of a meal (i.e. analysis of stomach contents) and their killing. The forensic Bioarchaeologist’s (defence expert) evidence at trial was broadly consistent with what she had agreed to in the joint statement. The gastroenterologist’s (prosecution expert) however, gave evidence at trial that his analysis of the stomach contents of the deceased enabled him to say (with 95% certainty) that the deceased individuals had died within 2 hours after eating their meal. Para 13. In his summing-up, the judge gave an initial direction as to expert evidence generally, before dealing with several expert witnesses from different disciplines who had given evidence in the course of the trial. The judge reminded the jury of what each of the expert witnesses had said both in evidence in-chief and when cross-examined. Counsel for defence asserted that the evidence for their expert was preferred because it was consistent, clear, thorough, properly explained and the result of four days of analysis. In contrast they contended that the prosecution expert’s evidence was unsatisfactory, that his opinion was fluctuating and uncertain, no one can say anything with 95 per cent certainty in this field and his analysis took place over only four hours. Counsel for defence furthered that there was no reason to question their expert’s findings and therefore no need to go behind the expert's joint statement. Counsel for defence accepted that just as the joint statement involves the discharge by expert witnesses of solemn duties cast upon them by the rules, so too does their individual preparation of individual reports. At each stage of the process the expert witness owes a duty to the court. Defence submits however that in the circumstances of this case, when the joint statement went before the jury a specific legal direction was needed explaining to the jury that the joint statement had been made by order of the court and explaining the circumstances in which it had been made, namely after meeting and discussion between the witnesses. It was further submitted that the jury should have been directed that the evidence of a witness who had departed from a joint statement should be examined carefully by the jury to see whether such a departure was explained and justified. Para 19. The judge explained the nature of expert evidence. He explained the need for the jury to evaluate its strengths and weaknesses as they would with any other witness. He reminded the jury that an expert witness is concerned only with one part of the case, whereas the jury must reach their verdicts on the whole of the evidence. Para 20. The judge went on to tell the jury that where expert witnesses disagreed, it was for the jury to judge their competing opinions.","

","With respect to evaluating the evidence presented on coercive control theory the appeal court highlighted that where the defendant suffers from a mental disorder, it was “well within” her (Prosecution expert) “competence and expertise”. As a result the court declined to receive one of the defence experts evidence because “it did not, in our judgment, advance the appeal significantly or at all”. The kernel of disagreement between two of the consultant forensic psychiatrists (prosecution vs defence experts) was whether the defendant was suffering from a mental disorder prior to the index offence implying there was diminished responsibility for her actions. The prosecution psychiatrist acknowledged she may have had personality disorder traits, but they did not exceed the normal limit for a diagnosis of personality disorder because in his opinion this would have conspicuously affected her relationships outside of her home, functioning at work and socially which he initially believed there was no evidence of this. The second psychiatrist was of the opinion the defendant suffered from a personality disorder of moderate clinical severity and has symptoms of a severe clinical mood disorder, most probably bipolar affective disorder.

The court regarded the circumstantial evidence presented by prosecution to be “unacceptably tenuous”

","Although the police mobile data had examined and downloaded the data from the telephone in question, he was unable to extract certain data missing from the download. Consequently, this material had to be reviewed manually. The relevant officer responsible for undertaking such a manual review was at that time on annual leave. It was only when the appellant was giving evidence at trial that the officer started to review the material on the phone. The evidence was eventually submitted – but it was submitted late.","Compile all of these notes into one word document.

",The dealing in drugs reflected by the different conspiracies was carried out principally – though not exclusively – via a website. This website was a market place for drugs and other illegal goods. Users of the website had to have a user account. As a result a digital record was kept of the transactions conducted by any account holder. The website was not available on the normal internet. It was on the dark web accessible using special software known by the acronym TOR. All traffic on the website was encrypted so that the identity of any user was concealed. Anyone conducting transactions using this website was required to pay using Bitcoin or some similar cryptocurrency. This further concealed and anonymised those transactions. In 2013 United States federal government intervention closed down this website. In September 2013 the back up server was seized from a data centre. This enabled the US authorities to identify the location of the website marketplace and linked Bitcoin servers,"

","This case concerned whether the appellant was suffering from a substantial impairment in her mental health / functioning (i.e. disordered thinking and mind as well as loss of control). This would give rise to a defence of diminished responsibility. The expert for defence argued she was suffering from an adjustment disorder with features of a personality disorder and autistic spectrum disorder. Counsel for defence contended the appellant had a loss of control at the material time whilst crown advanced the appellant had a loss in temper and there was an element of pre-planning in her behaviour. In relation to the safety warnings the judge, in summing up, gave directions: ""Can I just warn you to be cautious in relation to that matter, in this sense: that the brutality of the attack may assist you on the issue of intent. Equally, it may be a reflection of her mental disorder. That is something that you are going to have to assess."" In relation to suggested safety warning (2), this did not arise on the facts since the prosecution did not contend that this was a case involving pre-planning. In relation to suggested safety warnings (3) and (4), the judge gave the jury clear and appropriate guidance as to their approach to the expert evidence. He said: ""It is for you to evaluate and assess this evidence. It is for you to decide whether it assists you or not. If, after having given the matter careful consideration, you do not accept the evidence of the expert, in theory you do not have to act upon it. This is trial by jury, not trial by expert. While you may accept or reject expert opinion evidence you must not substitute your own opinions for those of the expert. However, in the present case the primary findings of the experts are not in dispute, so you would have to think long and hard before rejecting them.""

Commenting on the quality of expert testimony/evidence from expert 2 (Paras 96, 98, 99, 100, 102, 103 and 104) proffered during the trial proceedings the appeal court found his evidence “impressive” that, “as an expert, he regards the issue of whether a defendant had the requisite intent to commit an offence as being essentially for the jury. He considers that experts can contribute to that, but he has always been very cautious about saying that somebody could not form the intent with any degree of certainty because there are so many things that need to be taken into consideration.” In relation to fitness to plead and stand trial, we found impressive Dr Cumming's evidence that the applicant was ""a man really on form. He was really dealing with evidence, cross-examination ... really, really well"". That accords with our own impression, having read the transcripts of the applicant's evidence at his trial. 

The courts were also “impressed” by the fact that expert 2 appeared to give evidence which was specifically directed to the Pritchard criteria. He was clearly familiar with those criteria. They were also “impressed” with his evidence in regard to what he would have done had he been in the first experts at an earlier time. They furthered that in their view, that accords with what most responsible experts can be expected to do and would do. The expert in their view gave clear evidence in cross-examination that his opinion is that the applicant was fit to plead and stand trial from the information that he had seen.

","This was one of five cases heard together owing to the common issue as to the approach a sentencing judge should take when assessing for the purposes of a relevant sentencing guideline whether a victim of crime has suffered severe psychological harm. The questions raised for all five of these cases concerned whether: (1) the court should obtain expert evidence before making a finding of severe psychological harm? (2) If not, on what evidence can it act? (3) In particular, can the court make such a finding on the basis only of the contents of a Victim Personal Statement (""VPS"")? Defence for one of the five appellant accepted that expert evidence was not necessary in every case but submitted that consideration should be given to obtaining a clinical assessment of the psychological state of a victim whenever there is scope for argument as to the degree of psychological harm. She submitted that the court should be able to identify exactly what harm has been caused and not rely on the mere assertion of the victim. She furthered that the court should therefore require a clinical assessment of the victim before making a finding of severe psychological harm. In response prosecution contended that there is no such requirement and that it is appropriate for judges to use their forensic experience to make the necessary judgment. Expert evidence may be received, but it is not a necessary requirement and will only rarely help a judge. Para 12. It is was subsequently submitted that in the absence of expert evidence a judge has no benchmark against which to assess whether psychological harm is severe. No guidance is given as to whether, for example, such an assessment can be made on the basis of a single adverse psychological impact or whether a combination of psychological impacts is necessary. The defence suggested a list of the common signs and symptoms of PTSD or of depression could be provided with a checklist to enable a court to assess the degree of psychological harm. She does not argue that a written report is necessary in every case, because she recognises that in some cases the process of clinical assessment might in itself add to the trauma suffered by the victim. But she argues that it should not be left to a sentencing judge to make a purely subjective assessment when a list of relevant considerations could and should be provided. Para 14. The prosecution submitted that such a list of categories of adverse impact or of commonly encountered signs and symptoms would be impracticable. He points out that the circumstances of cases vary and that no such list could foresee all possible combinations of adverse impacts. He submits that the sentencing guidelines are properly predicated upon an experienced judge being able to assess in a particular case whether the psychiatric harm suffered by a victim can properly be described as severe. The court subsequently agreed with the prosecution submissions furthering that when a sentencing guideline directs a sentencer to assess whether the victim of an offence has suffered severe psychological harm or to make any other assessment of the degree of psychological harm, a judge is not thereby being called upon to make a medical judgment. The judge is, rather, making a judicial assessment of the factual impact of the offence upon the victim. Thus, submissions to the effect that a judge who makes a finding of severe psychological harm is wrongly making an expert assessment without having the necessary expertise are misconceived. The judge is not seeking to make a medical decision as to where the victim sits in the range of clinical assessments of psychological harm, but rather is making a factual assessment as to whether the victim has suffered psychological harm and, if so, whether it is severe.

","It was reported that the appellant had been seen by several medical doctors many specialising in psychiatry and one psychiatric nurse. There was a difference in opinion as to whether he was psychotic at the material time and whether this, and to what extent, diminished his responsibility. The courts heard arguments individuals suffering from a paranoid schizophrenia may be too distressed, ashamed confused or embarrassed to admit their condition and that such a condition may affect the ability to form rational judgment and exercise control. Conversely it was posited that there is a misconception that someone suffering with schizophrenia may not be able to lie, think straight or plan. Consequently, whether the appellant was in fact malingering, level of impairment, ability to plan and exert self-control were the central points of contention.
Defence referred to passages of cross-examination where the prosecution had sought to test the evidence called by the experts. The crown’s case was described as “simply a theory, a theory that was not supported by expert evidence. As a result, the jury were asked to reach their own conclusions as to the applicant's mental condition at the time of the killing. They were invited to act as amateur psychiatrists.” Defence referring to two case law decisions opined that it is not sufficient for the prosecution to suggest theories. The theories may be attractive to the lay person but if they have been positively contradicted by expert opinion the prosecution must have more. They should not simply invite speculation that the experts had been successfully duped [by the appellant] that he was mentally ill at the material time (hence malingering). On the judge’s directions being inadequate (ground 2) defence contended that “the judge's directions were tantamount to an invitation to the jury to substitute their personal opinions on a matter of psychiatric evaluation”. In summing up the judge reminded the jury they were entitled to take into account all the other evidence in the case and if it conflicted or outweighed the medical evidence they were not bound to accept the doctors' opinions. Referring to case law the point was made that “it is not open to the Crown in this kind of situation simply to invite the jury to convict of murder without suggesting why the expert evidence ought not to be accepted.” While he needs to make it clear to the jury that, if there is a proper basis for rejecting the expert evidence, the decision is theirs — that trial is by jury and not by expert — it will also ordinarily be wise to advise the jury against attempting to make themselves amateur psychiatrists, and that if there is undisputed expert evidence the jury will probably wish to accept it, unless there is some identified reason for not doing so. Referring to another case, it was advanced that the prosecution has right (if not duty) to assess the medical evidence and to challenge it, where there is a rational basis for so doing, but also on the primacy of the jury in determining the issue.",VIPER evidence was opined to be flawed and contaminated.,"Owing to the appellants inherent communication difficulties counsel for defence contended their client was disadvantaged and did not receive a fair trial. A report, outlining several recommendations, was proffered to the court: including the use of an intermediary throughout the trial, submission of written questions to the intermediary in advance of the hearing, a ground rules hearing, regular breaks, and the use of screens to avoid distraction. Specific guidance was also included as to how questioning of the appellant should be approached in order to maximise his comprehension and ability fairly to express himself. Para 20. On reaching a decision as to whether an intermediary could be regarded as an expert, the courts made reference to the case of R v Beards and Beards [2016] where it was stated: Whether a person is an expert is a matter for the Court based upon a proper analysis of the evidence. It is certainly not an issue which can be pre-judged by an individual's employer. Whether an individual is an expert within CPR 33 is fact and context specific. It depends upon the individual's professional skill and experience in the context of the particular issue that the evidence is said to be relevant to in the proceedings and it also takes into account whether the opinion evidence in question is outside of the jury's assumed knowledge and experience.","Several practitioners offered opinion evidence in this case: (1) a forensic consultant psychiatrist prepared a report. In his opinion the defendant has established history of paranoid schizophrenia and was unfit to plead or to stand trial. The psychiatrist furthered that he had been unable to complete a full assessment due to the offender's unwillingness to engage. (2) A doctor (whose core clinical profession was not reported) furnished a report that the defendant was unfit to plead or to stand trial. (3) Another doctor (whose clinical profession was not reported) opined, some 3 months later that the defendant was then fit to plead and stand trial. (4) The defendant’s Responsible clinician, a consultant forensic psychiatrist proffered an opinion on his mental disorder diagnosis and disposals. Para 54. the judgment of the court that, in addition to the orders under the Mental Health Act, was that an extended sentence should have been imposed on each of counts 1 to 6, consisting of a custodial term of fourteen years, with an extended period of licence of five years. This tariff replaces the eleven-year custodial period ordered by the trial judge.","Para 48. Commenting on the input from the experts, the appeal judge remarked: “The professor’s (Prosecution expert) written reports are clear on the matter. They are fully supported by other evidence and by a considerable quantity of Belgian law materials, including leading practitioners' text books of high authority.  Judging by the transcripts, we also gain the strong impression - one the trial judge clearly must have gained - that the Professor [prosecution expert] gave measured, consistent and authoritative answers refuting the defence case as put to him in a sustained and lengthy cross examination.  The defence case, on the other hand, depended to a great extent on the views of Dr [X] expressed in her recent thesis: views which, though entitled to respect, did not accord with numerous other authoritative texts and which could be said to be an advocation of what the writer thought the law ought to be rather than what it was.’
","Grievous bodily harm committed on 23 January 2016; Robbery committed on 19 February 2016; Robbery committed on 18 June 2016 ; Nine offences of fraud, also committed on 18 June 2016 ; The appeal court reviewed multiple offences committed by the appellant over four different dates. Consequently, different co-defendant’s were involved in committing the offences with the appellant.

","The salient question in this appeal hearing pertains to whether it is sufficient for the accused knew that digital files had been sent to him, say, as an attachment to an email, or an encrypted file by one of the many apps by which digital content may be transmitted. Can possession be established by demonstrating that material is contained in an attachment to an unopened email in an inbox? Or, as claimed here, where the information was transmitted through WhatsApp unsolicited by the accused, and without him viewing any or all of the material. Counsel clarified that possession involves both the physical and mental element and the mental element is knowledge; the defendant must knowingly have had custody and control of the video found on the device in question. ","Counsel for defence questioned the admissibility of the identification evidence because the witness had wrongly picked out three volunteers in the parades who were not involve in the index offence. Counsel also averred that the cell site evidence was as consistent with the appellant being at home or at his girlfriend's house as it was with his being at the scene of the attack. The judge subsequently asserted that the cell site evidence ""does not, standing alone, place the defendant at the scene"".

","The expert's conclusion was that the collision had been caused by the appellant driving at an excessive speed so that he could not negotiate the bend safely.

","
","Para 9. The court acknowledged that there was no direct forensic evidence to link the applicant to the burgled property. Para 20. The defence contend that there was no prosecution expert evidence presented to the jury linking the colour of the clothing seen in the CCTV footage with the clothes seized from the applicant's home. Para 23. According to the defence counsel, when the expert did come to give his evidence, was only able to give limited qualification to the identification drawn from the video evidence. He explained to the jury the process of storage of the digital information from cameras of this kind means that the digital information is compressed and therefore that the footage is less than perfect. However, (as stated in para 24) when the court examined the CCTV footage for themselves, they found the quality to be “pretty impressive”. With respect to linking the appellants clothing with the colours on the CCTV footage the court were of the view that an expert was not required and that the jury could use their own observations and common sense. The officer watched two videos of CCTV footage, at different angles, taken from within close vicinity of the crime scene. Here she identified the appellant from the first film and confirmed her identification with the second one. The defence submitted at trial that the officer’s identification from the video was not certain and that her viewing of the second video, which she only looked at once and she may have seen what she had wished to see; that her preconception had overmastered the attention she had given to the identification. Consequently, the defence advance the proposition that honest identifications can be wrong. Para 25. It was noted that the defence expert evidence had not been given at the time when the judge made his ruling relating to the bad character application and so he was not called on to assess that evidence.


","The application to appeal is based on ‘fresh’ lawyers, who did not represent the applicant at trial, lodging new Grounds of Appeal after refusal of the written application for leave to appeal by the single Judge. The court of appeal acknowledged that on occasions legitimate grounds have been identified by fresh lawyers that trial lawyers have missed and miscarriages of justice have been avoided. The original grounds of appeal (Para 45) in this case were: (i) and (ii) The judge made errors in summing up the evidence which were misleading and confusing. (iii) A juror indicated that she had had previous dealings with the Officer in the case, and the Officer could have influenced the verdicts. (iv) A prosecution witness and prosecution counsel referred to the first trial (in which the jury had been unable to reach a verdict) although the judge had indicated that there should be no reference to that trial. The witness' comment 'compounded' his bias. (v) Criticisms of the applicant's trial counsel. (vi) The DNA evidence should not have been admitted. (vii) The fingerprint evidence should not have been admitted. (viii) The prosecution relied upon unsigned statements. (ix) There was no proof of the warrant. (x) The Police Crime Scene Notes did not accord with the police officers' witness statements. (xi) There were issues with the schedule of non-sensitive unused material. (xii) The prosecution relied, in the re-trial, upon the evidence of Clinton Sinclair, who was not a credible witness.","In reaching a conclusion the appeal court stated that there will often be cases involving expert evidence where an issue arises, the resolution of which the experts are unable to directly help with, but where the application of common sense may be capable of providing the answer. This was, in our view, plainly such a case.


","The current case was one of two appeals which were heard together because they raised similar issue in principle. They were otherwise unrelated. The appellant was serving a 9 year sentence for a sexual offence. Owing to a deterioration in his condition, the appellant sought a reduction in the tariff imposed. Ahead of deliberating on the current case the court of appeal visited the guidelines for sentencing and criminal justice act 2003, the mandatory rules which set procedures for early release on compassionate grounds (ERCG). Reference was made to article 3 of the European Convention of Human rights, the Prison service order 6000 and the circumstances in which the Secretary of State may intervene on releasing a prisoner on compassionate grounds. The neurologist commissioned by the prosecution initially gave an opinion on the appellants fitness to plead. He confirmed the appellants diagnosis and outlined the symptoms. The experts report did not address the effects of the long sentence on the appellants terminal illness, the trial judge was aware that the appellant would physically deteriorate over time and was likely to die within the next 2-3 years. The second expert provided two reports (3 months between one another) proffering an opinion to the appeal court. The expert’s first report outlined the appellants medical history and current symptomology. The expert indicated to the court that appellants survival rate owing to the terminal illness was wide. He also gave an opinion on the progression of the illness and life expectancy. The healthcare providers report to the court provided an account on the appellants deterioration in physical health and the provisions in place to care for him. Mitigating factors included the appellant having no previous convictions, leading an “exemplary life, working as a respected teacher for many years, and having been appointed a magistrate”
","The current case was one of two appeals which were heard together because they raised similar issue in principle. They were otherwise unrelated.
The appellant was serving a 20-month sentence for a sexual offence. As her grounds of appeal she lodges that her personal circumstances and mitigation (especially her illness) were such that her sentence should have been suspended. Ahead of deliberating on the current case the court of appeal visited the guidelines for sentencing and criminal justice act 2003, the mandatory rules which set procedures for early release on compassionate grounds (ERCG). Reference was made to article 3 of the European Convention of Human rights, the Prison service order 6000 and the circumstances in which the Secretary of State may intervene on releasing a prisoner on compassionate grounds. A pre-sentence report (? Furnished by a probation officer) made referred to the appellants medical condition, her physical capabilities and resultant healthcare needs. The author of the report, in their opinion, stated that the “appellant's physical deterioration had clearly led to an emotional and psychological deterioration”. Despite testimonial letters from the appellants family, the court noted that there was “no formal medical evidence before the court, and in particular no psychiatric or psychological report.” The judge noted that the appellant was of previous good character. Significantly at Para 31 the court noted that at that juncture there “still no medical evidence to support the suggestions made in the pre-sentence report. In granting an adjournment, this court directed that a psychiatrist be instructed to interview the appellant in prison and to prepare a report directed to the issue of whether her mental health condition is or may be causally connected to her commission of the offence and if so, how and to what extent.” A consultant forensic psychiatrist was subsequently commissioned by the defence. She outlined the appellants medical condition/s, symptoms and intensity. She also reported on the appellants restricted physical condition. Para 36. The expert was of the opinion that the appellant's physical conditions may have masked symptoms of a co-existing mental disorder, with the result that the severity of the mental disorder was not recognised and treated. The expert went on to state (para 37) that “the index offence is of a very serious nature and there is no direct relationship between [the appellant's] mental illness and offending. Nonetheless, the offence occurred at a time when [the appellant] was clinically depressed. Poor decision making is a core symptom of depression and in my opinion, reduced ability to exercise judgment may offer a partial explanation as to [the appellant's] actions.” The court judged on the basis of evidence presented, that there was no medical evidence showing a direct link between the appellant's mental health and her offending. Dr Whitworth's expert opinion goes no further than establishing a partial reduction in the appellant's ability to exercise judgment at the material time. The court therefore judged that the appellant case fell “well short of the exceptional circumstances which must be shown if the Bernard principles are to be relied upon” with respect to early release on compassionate grounds.","Where this was a case concerned a case of negligence in aviation, it was initially presented to a Court Martial which the appeal court acknowledged as specialist tribunal with different provisions and sentencing guidelines

","Trial Judge initiated a stay in proceedings on the basis that a fair trial would not be possible. The victim made an initial complaint about being indecently assaulted. At that moment in time counsel for the respondent contend the police had a duty to seize the victims mobile phone. During subsequent police investigation the victim reported that she has sent text messages to her friends after she was indecently assaulted. It was only then that the police seized her telephone and the contents were downloaded. Stressing the failure to seize the complaints mobile phone at the earliest opportunity, at Para 13, reference made to case law Ebrahim where a phone download was described “for the majority of younger persons is tantamount to a running commentary upon their day to day lives, feelings and interaction. Secondly, evidentially ... this evidence goes to the heart of the defence ability to cross-examine a complainant upon a record of their own making. The absence of such material deprives the trial process as a whole because it may be relevant to the prosecution case too, of likely very important contemporaneous evidence."" Reference was made to the Crown Prosecution Service's ' Guidelines on Communication Evidence' ('CPS Guidelines'): .1. Communications between suspects, complainants or witnesses can be of critical significance whether as evidence in support of the prosecution case or as unused material which either undermines it or assists the defence case. 2. Investigating officers are required to pursue all reasonable lines of inquiry, whether to exonerate or implicate suspects, under the Code of Practice issued under CPIA 1996. 3. The Attorney General's Guidelines on Disclosure provide assistance on what amounts to a reasonable line of enquiry. The investigator must decide how best to pursue a reasonable line of enquiry in respect of such material, ensuring that the extent and manner of it examination are commensurate with the issues in the case. This should be achieved in consultation with the prosecutor, if appropriate. Reference was also made to the Guide to ""reasonable lines of enquiry"" and Communications Evidence' was published by the DPP ('DPP Guide') which states: 
""13. The examination of mobile devices belonging to the complainant is not a requirement as a matter of course in every case. There will be cases where there is no requirement for the police to take the media devices of a complainant or others at all, and thus no requirement for even a level 1 examination to be undertaken. Examples of this would include sexual offences committed opportunistically against strangers, or historic allegations where there is considered to be no prospect that the complainant's phone will retain any material relevant to the period in which the conduct is said to have occurred and/or the complainant through age or other circumstances did not have access to a phone at that time...The appeal courts opined that the trial judge decided that there was no evidence that material from EC's phone had been deliberately erased or eliminated.","Counsel for defence [para 15] submitted that the police officer should not have been treated as an expert witness. The defence averred that the officer's evidence about the gang being an organised crime network was wholly unsubstantiated and later in the trial was in fact contradicted by defence evidence. The defence asserted that the officer's evidence was presented in very generalised and vague terms and was for that reason difficult for the defence to challenge. Para 25. It was asserted that, it is often the case in a joint trial that evidence may be admissible against one accused but not against another. The court concluded that there were no arguable grounds for appeal against the conviction and that the appeal against sentence also failed.",Evidence of bad character is admissible 'only if goes no further than is necessary to correct a false impression. Forensic experts agreed that the DNA on one of the guns could have come from secondary transfer,"There was a potential difficulty with the processes in the relevant laboratory used for scientifically screening the urine test results. It follows that the evidence of the metabolite AEME, indicating the consumption of crack cocaine as opposed to powdered cocaine, might be unreliable. As a result, the appellant's sample was re-tested. ","Para 45. The judge, in the absence of the jury, said: “it is regrettable that we did not hear from the medical experts and perhaps I too readily agreed to the matter proceeding on the basis of the joint statement, but the jury now have to do the best on the evidence they have got.” In making his submission, the counsel for defence [para 79] averred: “that the joint statement of the medical experts was unhelpful to the jury, and new medical evidence, at the very least, cast grave doubts on the safety of the conviction.” Para 85. The expert medical evidence that was presented to the jury was limited to the short joint statement signed by the two experts…Not only did the joint statement failed to identify the areas of disagreement, which should properly have been the subject of live evidence, it failed to address the possible causes of the injury in the clear way that both experts had set out in their reports. With regards DNA evidence, it was adverted at para 90 that “there were no traces of his DNA either on (the victim) or anywhere else where it might have been deposited if sexual activity had occurred. Nor was there any trace of her DNA or her blood found on the appellant, except some blood on the lower part of one of his trouser legs where it might have been expected if no offence had been committed. Although there was a delay of 20 hours in taking samples and checking for blood, there was evidence that he had not taken an opportunity to rid himself of incriminating forensic material prior to the sample taking.” The appeal court judgment was to quash the conviction owing new medical and psychological evidence successfully deployed many years after the trial challenging the conviction. The appellants learning disability may have rendered him to being vulnerable to suggestion and acquiescent during the original trial proceedings, especially during cross-examination. Consequently, the judge queried whether he received a fair trial given the appellants attenuated level of functioning affecting his diminished ability to reason, understand, process and retain complex information.","Diminished responsibility:- The kernel of this case concerns the appellant’s degree of culpability for murdering her newly born baby owing to her mental state at the material time. All three of the psychiatrists agreed that the appellant was fit to pleat although she had been diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome (a high spectrum autistic disorder). They did not believe this disorder contributed to any psychiatric defence. All experts agreed there were affective problems prior to the alleged offence: Defence expert 1: Depression secondary to paranoid psychosis. Defence expert 2: Severe depressive episode. Prosecution expert: insufficient evidence to make a diagnosis of depression. However, the three psychiatrists had varying opinions about the diagnoses of the appellant at the material time. Defence expert 1: Paranoid schizophrenia. Defence expert 2: Severe depresson with psychotic symptoms – depressive psychosis. Prosecution expert: No evidence of psychotic symptoms prior to the offence. Giving birth created an acute stress reaction, in some respect traumatic experience, which yielded an imbalance in her mind. The defence experts supported a partial defence of diminished responsibility whereas the crown expert said there was insufficient evidence of it. As to infanticide, the defence experts supported a defence on this basis, whereas the prosecution expert rejected it. Pre-existing mental disorder exacerbated by the circumstance of the birth.",The appeal hearing focused predominantly on juror bias with numerous details about the original trial not provided. Experts witnesses did not seem the be involved. The results from the DNA investigations were presented by the prosecution.,"Ten appellant case’s were heard together at this appeal although they were tried in two separate trials. The convictions arose out of the same incident, albeit the sentence of each appellant have certain common themes. DNA experts did not present testimony during the court proceedings the prosecution disclosed the findings
","""There is an issue to be resolved as to whether the experts for the Crown conducted their work properly and reliably. In order to be properly advised by our expert, the defence need to know the precise processes which were followed (including a step by step description of each stage of the process and the names of programmes used). As yet our expert has been unsuccessful in obtaining these working notes or this information. We request its provision to the defence."" Para 19. The defence counsel placed reliance on a number of the provisions of the ACPO Guidance in relation to disclosure of digital material (the ""Good Practice Guide for Digital Evidence"" published by the Association of Chief Police Officers)… the defence counsel further contended that there was no proper audit trail of the work done by the prosecution experts. Retrieving emails from one of the mobile phones was difficult owing to two levels of encryption. First, there was a level of encryption which was a standard feature of the phone and which in this case had been activated. Secondly, there was an additional level of encryption provided by software known as ""PGP"" which had been added to the phone. PGP stands for ""Pretty Good Protection"". The first expert who examined the phone on behalf of the prosecution was unable to get past the PGP. He found that there were 28 emails on the BlackBerry device, three of which had been deleted, but he was unable to read the emails because the encryption prevented him from reading them. A further expert witness instructed by the prosecution was more successful. He was able to read and to take screenshots of 23 emails passing between someone who had been using the phone.During the trial, there was a difference between the findings of the first expert and the findings of the second expert as to the number of deleted emails. PII application: the prosecution made an application to withhold details of one of the digital expert’s methods on the grounds of public interest indicating that PGP was rarely encountered by the police but was known to be used by persons engaged in high level drug dealing. The prosecution submitted that the ACPO Guidance had been complied with, and that the mobile in question had been made available to the defence digital expert for examination, but the specialist lacked knowledge which had enabled their expert (but not him) to decrypt the messages. It was submitted that the method used by their expert was highly confidential and that if it became known to more people there was a risk that the information would fall into the hands of criminals. It was therefore submitted that disclosure of their expert's precise methodology would run the risk of serious prejudice to an important public interest, namely the prevention and detection of crime. The court was accordingly invited to rule that their expert's methodology should be protected by public interest immunity. The recorder conducted the PII hearing in the absence of the defence and subsequently permitted the prosecution to withhold any further material relating to their digital expert’s methodology. The trial proceeded with the prosecution expert giving evidence, but without the obligation of explaining precisely what technique he had used. One of the police officers who gave evidence at the trial and who was experienced in drugs cases gave evidence that the PGP security cost in excess of £1,000 for 12 months. Part 19.4(4) of the Criminal Procedure Rules relating to expert evidence: where a defendant seeks to exclude from expert evidence on grounds of non-disclosure, the challenge may be made either as a challenge to admissibility on the basis of non-compliance with rule 19.3(3) or as an application to exclude the evidence on grounds of fairness","

","Para 34. The courts were concerned with the appellants mental make-up at the time of the offence rather than after, it was noted  that ‘highly-qualified experts had not seen the applicant in a condition which showed that his ASD was a significant feature of his mental makeup at the time. The totality of the evidence shows that this applicant's condition seriously deteriorated after his admission into custody. This is consistent with [psychologist’s] evidence that the effect of the condition upon the applicant is substantially determined by his environmental circumstances at any given time.’ Consequently, the court of appeal concluded at para 35. ‘this court is required to consider the applicant's condition as at the time of the offence. It must also consider the effect of that condition upon his actions, and in particular upon his intentions and perceptions at that time. Given that this was not a spontaneous and unexpected event, and given a lack of evidence to show that in May 2010 this applicant's condition was such as significantly to impact upon his behaviour at the time of the offence, we do not consider that the fresh evidence was of a nature and strength to undermine the safety of the conviction.’

","Para 30. The well-known test for the admissibility of fresh evidence is contained in s.23 of the 1968 Act and provides (so far as material) as follows: ""(1) For the purposes of an appeal, or an application for leave to appeal, under this Part of this Act the Court of Appeal may, if they think it necessary or expedient in the interests of justice – (c) receive any evidence which was not adduced in the proceedings from which the appeal lies. (2) The Court of Appeal shall, in considering whether to receive any evidence, have regard in particular to –  (a) whether the evidence appears to the Court to be capable of belief; (b) whether it appears to the Court that the evidence may afford any ground for allowing the appeal; (c) whether the evidence would have been admissible in the proceedings from which the appeal lies on an issue which is the subject of the appeal; and (d) whether there is a reasonable explanation for the failure to adduce the evidence in those proceedings."" Para 71. there is no good reason why evidence of this nature could not have been obtained for use at trial. Para 72. there must be very real concern that the conclusions of the Psychologists go beyond the proper remit of expert witnesses and stray into the province of the jury. This concern is acute with regard to the questions from the Applicant's solicitors and the answers from the experts in 2015-2016 going to the Applicant's levels of compliance and suggestibility…the experts' conclusions would have been largely inadmissible at trial, albeit that their assessments of the Applicant would have been admissible, at least to some extent…the impact of the medical evidence falls necessarily to be reduced. Para 73. we have real misgivings that the evidence might afford any ground for allowing the appeal. Over and above the need to confine the experts to their proper province, the medical evidence was obtained some 7 – 10 years after the trial. Though different shades of opinion appear from the medical evidence….it is difficult to apply a 2014-2017 assessment of the Applicant to her condition in late 2007…it is also a reality that by the time of her assessment she had experienced a substantial period of imprisonment. It certainly cannot be excluded that the experience of imprisonment would have impacted on her condition when subsequently seen by the experts – but would of course not have been present at the time of trial and prior to her experience of custody. Para 74. For all these reasons, especially when considered cumulatively, we do not think that the reception of the medical evidence would be necessary or expedient in the interests of justice and we decline to admit it into evidence on the application.","Para 13. The expert evidence went on to explain that the DNA could have resulted from direct transfer from the appellant or secondary transfer. It was not possible to say when the DNA was transferred to a particular surface, or for how long the DNA had been present on the surface. There was no expert evidence on the blood transfer. The evidence was that the blood could be transferred if wet, if dry, or if dried blood had become really animated because it had become wet. Para 31. Reference was made to case law R v Tsekiri: (1) Where it is clear that the DNA has been directly deposited in the course of the commission of a crime by the assailant, a very high DNA match with the defendant would be sufficient without more to give rise to a case for the defendant to answer: (see Tsekiri, paragraph 6). (2) Where the DNA found on movable articles left at the scene of a crime is the only evidence, nevertheless that can be sufficient without more to raise a case to answer where the match probability is 1: 1 billion or similar. (The conclusion to the contrary in the case of Bryon is not correct): Tsekiri paragraph 14. (3) In this second class of case, whether the DNA alone is sufficient to raise a case to answer will depend on the facts of the particular case. Relevant factors include non-exhaustively the following six factors (set out at Tsekiri paragraphs 15 to 20 and 21): (a) Is there any evidence of some other explanation for the presence of the defendant's DNA on the item other than involvement in the crime? (b) Was the article apparently associated with the offence itself? (c) How readily movable was the article (on which the DNA was found) in question? (d) Is there evidence of some geographical association between the offence and the assailant? (e) Where the case is one of mixed profile is the DNA profile which matches the defendant the major contributor to that profile? (f) Is it more or less likely that the DNA profile attributable to the defendant was deposited by primary or secondary transfer? (4) Finally, there is not evidential or legal principle which prevents a case, solely dependent on the presence of DNA on an article left at the scene of a crime being considered by a jury: Tsekiri at paragraph 21. DNA profiling was used with experts using specialist probabilistic genotyping software to assess the result. ","

","Para 88: According to the treating psychiatrists opinion the diagnosis of the appellant’s condition was complex. His evidence was that the appellant suffers from three conditions which the doctor said were a mild learning disorder, a borderline personality disorder and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In the doctor’s view the mild learning disorder and the personality disorder had been present since childhood. According to para 91, the psychiatrist considered that each of the disorders from which the appellant suffers is treatable. His learning disorder and PTSD are treatable with appropriate therapy and the personality disorder is susceptible to treatment with medication. Para 96: In the appeal judges opinion had the sentencing judge been aware of the appellant’s mental disorder he would have imposed a hospital order under s.37 with a s.41 restriction. The judge advanced that the appellant’s culpability should have been assessed as low owing to his mental disorder.
","Defendant cast/threw acid on the victim on 23.09.15. Victim died on 02.01.17 due to voluntary euthanasia, by lethal injection, lawfully administered to him in a hospital in Belgium. The act of euthanasia was deemed to be independent, free and voluntary act which broke the chain of causation between the defendant's conduct in throwing the acid, and victim's death. At the close of the prosecution case, at the invitation of the defence the judge withdrew the charge of murder from the jury - the central issue for decision in this appeal case is whether the trial judge was justified in doing this. Euthanasia is lawful in Belgium if carried out in accordance with the Belgian Act on Euthanasia of 28 May 2002.  The Belgian authorities have refused to provide the Crown with medical records of the deceased's treatment in Belgium on the grounds of patient confidentiality. Para 25. Upon charging the defendant with murder, the jury would need to be sure that the defendant's act was a cause of death; it need not be the sole or principal cause, as long it was a substantial cause, which meant a more than minimal cause. The defence submitted that the act of voluntary euthanasia was a free, deliberate and informed decision – a new intervening act that broke the chain of causation, in circumstances where the victim could survive. The jury could be told that the evidence concerned only the victims state of mind and that it could not be treated as evidence of expert medical opinion. On that limited basis, the evidence was admissible hearsay. There was a passage in the father's witness statement that the judge was not prepared to allow. This was that: ""Without the euthanasia [the victim] would only have lived for another 2-3 days but in an inhumane way."" The judge's provisional view was that this evidence was inadmissible because it would be impossible for the jury to divorce the fact of the statement from the truth of its content. The victim's choice to die, combined with the actions of the Belgian doctors who ended his life, constituted an intervening cause, breaking the chain of causation as a matter of law. If the victim had been given a lethal injection by a doctor in this jurisdiction that doctor would have faced a charge of murder. Murder in this jurisdiction would be bound to have constituted an independent act. The fact that the killing was lawfully carried out in Belgium made no difference to the effect of the actions of the doctor in breaking the chain of causation. In the criminal context the proper approach was simply to ask the jury to consider the question whether the defendant's actions were a substantial and operating cause of death. The decision of the victim to apply for euthanasia, and the doctor's act in giving effect to that decision, were matters which the jury would need to consider in answering that question. The issue that the judge had to address was whether the charge of murder could properly be left to the jury on these facts. More specifically, could a jury properly directed find the conduct of the defendant in throwing acid over the victim was a legally sufficient cause of his death; or would the jury be bound to conclude (as, in the event, the judge decided) that the intervening actions of the victim in asking for euthanasia and actions of the Belgian doctors in complying with his request had severed the causal connection between her conduct and his death, thereby absolving her of the legal responsibility for his death? The central question…did the act of euthanasia sever, or break, the chain of causation leading to the victim’s death? or were actions of the defendant an operational and sufficiently significant cause of death?","This was one of four cases which listed together before this court of appeal hearing to consider issues arising from the sentencing of mentally ill offenders to indeterminate terms of imprisonment. Para 8/9: post sentence information may impact on and produce a reduction in sentence (the sentence may be reduced on appeal) The exception is very limited - it will include updated pre-sentence and prison reports on contact in prison after sentence but not fresh psychiatric or psychological evidence in support of an argument that a finding of dangerousness ought not to have been made or a hospital order should have been made. The appellant was found guilty of manslaughter, subsequent to murdering her mother. She was not found to be culpable for the offence owing to her psychosis. However, she has a history of erratic non-compliance with medication during which she would rapidly relapse with psychotic symptoms. 13 years earlier she had been convicted of GBH having stabbed and choked her daughter. During that time, she received a hospital order under the MHA. 
The case concerned whether it would be more appropriate that the appellant receives a custodial sentence to be served should be via the criminal justice with probation monitoring or through a hospital disposal - s37/41 (MHA) Hospital order with limitation directions. One of the psychiatrists, treating the appellant gave expert evidence about her mental state, level of dangerousness when compliant/non-complaint with psychotropic medication, rate of relapse and whether the criminal justice or hospital order provisions would be most appropriate disposal for the appellant. The psychiatrists giving evidence were of the opinion there was diminished responsibility and she most likely would not have committed the offence had she been compliant with her prescribed medication. Where the appellant had a history of harming a relative, non-compliance with medication, the judge noted that the appellant had knowingly chosen to discontinue her medication that controlled her condition, she previously had a hospital disposal and had now committed another serious offence the Judge opted for the criminal justice s45A disposal albeit reduced the minimum term originally imposed.","

Under section 23 of the Criminal Appeals Act 1968, one of the matters to be considered is whether the proposed fresh evidence would provide a ground for allowing the appeal. Para 34. The prosecution will be relying upon an analysis by someone experienced and skilled in the work of image recovery from one or more devices, and will be guided by that analysis as to the number and characterisation of the relevant images.
","Para 27. The psychologist offering an expert opinion concluded that the appellant had a number of psychological vulnerabilities related to his comprehension of verbal information, his capacity for processing information when under stress, literacy skills and communication skills that would place him at risk of lacking competence to participate meaningfully in court proceedings without adjustments. Appropriate adjustments could include the assistance of a professional intermediary to ensure that he understands information needed to instruct his legal representative


","There was a delay of 7 years since the original incident and the current hearing. Following an inquest in July 2011, the police accident investigator at the time gave evidence at the inquest. It appeared that she “somewhat modified” her estimate of the speed limit at which the respondent had been travelling (not in excess of the 30mph speed limit). Some years later, the daughter of the deceased made a complaint to the IPCC about the offence. She subsequently challenged the IPCCs conclusion that the original investigation had been carried out in accordance with proper police standards - new accident investigator report was subsequently commissioned. It contained a conclusion, derived particularly from momentum calculations based on the available data, that the speed of the motorcycle just before the point of impact was around 49mph. In regard to the delay in re-opening this case, the judge noted that sometimes delays can be caused by a lack of evidence at the time which subsequently emerges many years later owing to advances in science. ""The longer a person is left to believe he will not be prosecuted, the more unjust it becomes for the prosecution to renege on their promise …."" The prosecution cannot simply discard a reputable expert, and some years later find another expert whose opinion will allow them to say in isolation that there is now a realistic prospect of conviction, whereas before there was not. Para 32. The court of appeal concluded that the trial judge's ruling should be reversed on the basis that it involved an error of principle and resulted in a ruling which was not reasonable for the judge to have made. We will therefore order that the proceedings for the offence charged be resumed in the Crown Court.


","In opening the appeal judge highlighted two key considerations: First, the duty of an expert to the Court, in particular to stay within the area of his expertise. Secondly, the sole test for this Court when deciding whether to allow or dismiss an appeal against conviction: namely, whether that conviction is unsafe. Para 32. The serious fraud office (SFO) gave instructions to an expert (from a former trader who ran a company providing expert consulting and testimony in banking cases) to provide a report ""explaining the workings of an investment bank, inter-dealing brokerage and related financial instruments and trading terms used by individuals within these institutions"". The letter of instructions drew specific attention to the duty of an expert ""to give objective unbiased opinion on matters within their expertise"", together with the relevant provisions of the Crim PR. Para 34. In March 2016, the defendants in the trial sought a pre-trial hearing to exclude or restrict Rowe's evidence, on the ground of lack of expertise. Although it was accepted that Rowe had some general banking experience, it was contended that he had no direct experience of interest rate derivatives trading, cash trading or making LIBOR submissions. His evidence ought to be restricted to the ""core"" of his report, covering the structure of banks, financial concepts and an overview of the relevant financial instruments in the case. It was furthered that the expert in question, should be prevented from giving ""inadmissible evidence as to the permissible approach to the LIBOR-setting process, the permissible extent of communications between traders and LIBOR submitters, or whether conduct of any kind is or could be regarded as being dishonest"". Rowe was not competent to provide opinion evidence on such matters. He had never worked as an interest rate derivatives trader, a cash desk trader or a LIBOR submitter and appeared to have no direct knowledge of the LIBOR submission process. He had not worked as a trader of any kind since 2000 and, from 2005 onwards, had acted as a professional expert witness on general banking disputes. Para 35. Resisting the defence application, the SFO response was that, as shown by the declaration in his expert's report, the expert understood his duty to the Court, including as to expressing his opinion (only) on matters within his expertise. The SFO pointed to the fact that he had given expert evidence in two previous LIBOR trials, apparently without challenge to his expertise. Nor had there been any challenge from the defence to the accuracy or reliability of the evidence proposed to be adduced by the expert. It would be open to the defence to cross-examine him at the trial on his alleged lack of expertise. Para 36. The matter was subsequently presented to the trial judge who observed that there was no real dispute as to the principles governing the admissibility of expert evidence. The essential question was whether the witness was skilled, rather than the way he came by his skill. The key passage in the Judge's ruling was as follows: ‘I cannot assess his [Rowe's] expert knowledge against that of any expert to be called by the defence, because the defence do not intend to call any expert evidence. Whether, as a result of cross-examination, deficiencies in his knowledge become exposed will have to wait for the trial process to resolve. Whether he is right in what he says, I cannot at this stage say, and in any event I should not usurp the task of the jury in this regard.’ he judge furthered that: ‘I do not consider that I am in the area, as Mr Darbishire QC [for Reich] would put it, of hearing an expert in orthopaedics give evidence about cardiology, but rather that I have a witness who has an expertise in banking matters and, no doubt, more so in some areas than others. This is something that can be tested by the defence and the jury can decide what weight they should give to his evidence in respect of any particular point.’ Upon the receiving further material from the SFO and expert the judge excluded the evidence concluding: "" ….the lack of any detailed analysis by [the expert] in his report as to the basis for his opinion and, without any research being apparent into what was in fact happening at Barclays at the time on which he could have relied, leads me to rule that, as the report is presented, there is no admissible basis for his evidence on this issue."" It surfaced that the sections of the experts report were not advanced by him but by another professional. Additionally, according to para 40, despite being explicitly told by the judge that he was not to discuss this case with anyone whilst his evidence was in progress, the expert communicated with three other individuals. The expert subsequently gave evidence that he ran a company providing expert consulting and testimony in banking cases. He had worked in the finance industry between 1989 and 2000. He gave evidence concerning various banking terms and concepts. The appeal court, making reference to an expert witness, averred to his conduct fall below the standards expected of an expert witness in many different ways. At the trial, in the absence of the fresh (disclosure) material, the Appellant's counsel had been inhibited in his ability to cross-examine Rowe as to his credibility or expertise It was now clear that Rowe's failings as an expert were extensive; thus: “….he had signed documents stating that he had complied with his duties when he knew he hadn't; he had failed to report with any detail or accuracy as to how he reached his opinions; he secretly consulted with a number of undisclosed advisors; he blatantly disregarded the directions of a trial judge during the course of a criminal trial; and he knowingly gave evidence about matters outside his area of competence. These are deeply troubling failings that bring the system of justice into disrepute…” The fresh material would have permitted devastating cross-examination. It did do just that at the retrial, where both defendants were acquitted. The duty resting on an expert witness is so fundamental that where it is abused, the entire process is affected:  ""….It leads to the peculiarity of a trial in which the prosecution seeks to prove the dishonesty of a defendant and in order to do so calls a dishonest expert as an essential building block of their case.…There may be circumstances in which that state of affairs does not impinge upon the safety of the conviction. But this was not one of them.""The appeal court ultimately asserted that the expert “had not complied with his duties as an expert.” In summing up the trial judge averted: "" ….you have heard from two experts, who gave evidence on behalf of the prosecution about banking concepts and practice relevant to this case. Expert evidence is permitted to assist you with matters which are likely to be outside your experience and knowledge. As with any evidence, it is for you to decide what you accept and what you reject….You should take account of their qualifications and to what extent their practical experience equipped them to give evidence on the topics they were asked about.’ Para 50. The expert was subject to cross-examination, which included his duties as an expert, and the declaration in his report, required by the Crim PR. The Judge's summing-up at the retrial said: ""Despite that catalogue of experience, you may have formed a judgment that he knew very little about the duties of being an expert……he seems to have been perfectly content to sign a standard declaration in which he declared that he had read the Criminal Procedure Rules which govern his conduct as an expert, both before trial and in giving evidence, and the booklet on his duties of disclosure without doing anything really to familiarise himself with either of those documents….    Any expert is entitled to research a topic on which he is to give evidence and obtain the views of others, including work colleagues, about it to enhance his opinion, so long as he records where he went for that advice and so long as it is to enhance an expertise he already has, rather than to become an expert on a subject where he has no knowledge whatsoever……There seems to be no dispute that he has a general expertise in banking and finance and that many of the issues he dealt with involved basic matters which are not in dispute.……But there are other areas of his evidence where you would be entitled to conclude that he has gone beyond his general knowledge of banking into very specific areas, which were at the very edge of or beyond his knowledge. Para 53 adduces the legal framework (Part 19 of the Crim Procedure Rules) covering an expert witness’s duties to the court: (1) An expert must help the court to achieve the overriding objective –  (a) by giving opinion which is – (i) objective and unbiased, and (ii) within the expert's area or areas of expertise…..(2) This duty overrides any obligation to the person from whom the expert receives instructions or by whom the expert is paid. (3) This duty includes obligations – (a) to define the expert's area or areas of expertise – (i) in the expert's report, and (ii) when giving evidence in person (b) when giving evidence in person, to draw the court's attention to any question to which the answer would be outside the expert's area or areas of expertise…."" Guidance Booklet for Expert's Disclosure: Experts' Evidence, Case Management and Unused Material. Para 54. The essence of the matter is straightforward. As explained in the ""standard"" direction given to juries in respect of expert evidence (see above, for the direction given by the Judge at the trial), expert evidence is adduced to assist with matters likely to be outside their experience and knowledge. A partisan expert is quite incapable of furnishing such assistance, quite apart from the breach of ethical and legal duties thus entailed. So too, to state the obvious, expert evidence must be expert; it can only be such if it is within the expert's area/s of expertise; if the so-called expert witness gives evidence outside of his area/s of expertise it is both of no use to the jury and corrosive of the trust placed in such witnesses. Referring to case law (para 55) Silverlock [1894] 2 QB 766, at 771"" ….It is true that the witness who is called upon to give evidence founded on a comparison of handwritings must be peritus; he must be skilled in doing so; but we cannot say that he must have become peritus in the way of his business or in any definite way. The question is, is he peritus? Is he skilled? Has he an adequate knowledge? Looking at the matter practically, if a witness is not skilled the judge will tell the jury to disregard his evidence. There is no decision which requires that the evidence of a man who is skilled in comparing handwriting, and who has formed a reliable opinion from past experience, should be excluded because his experience has not been gained in the way of his business……""In the appeal court summing up the judge asserted: We accept that the principal reason for the SFO calling [the expert] to introduce to the jury essentially uncontroversial banking and trading concepts. Thus far, as the Judge observed in the summing-up in the retrial, he had sufficient general expertise to act as an expert. Where [the expert] went wrong – gravely wrong, as we have concluded – was to go further and enter into debate on topics, beyond or at the very outer edge of his expertise. The SFO conducted an internal discussion following the expert’s presentation and condemnation by the appeal court, they subsequently concluded that the experts conduct resulted from a failure of integrity on his part rather than a failure of SFO policies or procedures. The SFO undertook to look again at the matter to see whether there was any way in which it could reinforce expert witnesses' awareness of their obligations under the Crim PR…..On an endnote the judge asserted that  ‘this case stands as a stark reminder of the need for those instructing expert witnesses to satisfy themselves as to the witness' expertise and to engage (difficult though it sometimes may be) an expert of a suitable calibre.’

","the law in relation to hearsay evidence is clear: the jury should be warned of the limitations of such evidence; in particular, the fact that it cannot be tested in the way that other evidence may be tested at trial. Para 30. It was argued that one of the psychiatrists giving evidence may have gone too far by suggesting that ‘a male murderer might disguise his crime as suicide’. Para 31. During the original trial, the judge gave a conventional direction on expert evidence at the summing-up: “Consideration of evidence relating to possible suicide. You've heard from two experts. In fact, you've heard from three but two on this topic, both experienced consultant psychiatrists who obviously have been, as they told you, in a large number of other cases and can assist the jury with their specialist knowledge of certain topics. You are not bound by their evidence. They are there to assist you with their expertise. They give their opinions. That's the purpose of expert evidence. They are entitled to say what their findings are and to give their opinions in a court of law, but you are the judges of the facts.”

","

","Several cases were listed together before this court of appeal hearing to consider issues arising from the sentencing of mentally ill offenders to indeterminate terms of imprisonment. The judge commented that the appellant had chosen to discontinue the medication that controlled his condition. Para 65. The psychiatrist contended “mental health professionals are better prepared to detect and respond to early signs of mental deterioration than would be the case were the appellant to be managed under the life sentence regime.  Probation staff are not highly trained in the assessment of mental illness and might thereby be less effective in managing risk.  She reiterated a recommendation that a hospital order should be made.” In order to self-qualify her recommendations to the court the psychiatrist, making reference to her experience, stipulated that she had been a psychiatric member of the Parole Board for 8 years during which time she had had contact with psychiatrists who supervised offenders on licence. Para 67. The appeal judge expressed doubts about the appellants treating psychiatrists recommendations for her patients release provisions. Para 69. The appeal judge stressed “…that although the outcome of this appeal follows the recommendations in the medical evidence, our conclusion was not based upon the submissions made to us that the result in Ahmed should be regarded as being of general application. We bore in mind the guidance in Vowles at [51] that a court should not feel circumscribed by psychiatric opinion. Our conclusion in this case that a s37/41 order is the most suitable disposal is the consequence of careful examination of all the relevant circumstances including but not limited to the fresh medical evidence.”

",,"Para 11. The central issue at the preparatory hearing was the admissibility of psychological evidence whether the evidence was relevant to the question of intent. The Judge ruled against the admissibility of the evidence. Thereafter he ruled that the application for leave to appeal was out of time and, in any event, without merit. Para 14. In regards to the merits of the psychological evidence, the judge expressed the general principle that the admissibility of psychological evidence was limited to cases of alleged duress and suggestibility in confessions. It is a mistake to refer to that general principle as a rule. The rule is no more than a requirement that, in order to admit the evidence, it must satisfy the appropriate criteria in law. Para15. The defence relied on two decisions of this court to suggest that psychological evidence could also be admitted on the question of intent. Thompson [2014] EWCA Crim 836 considered the admissibility of expert evidence about Asperger's Syndrome in the context of sexual offences. The judge commented that Thompson was not of any real assistance as it was the duty of the court to consider in each case the relevance of such evidence to the issues in the case. In regards to another case (Grant-Murray), adduced at para 17, the appeal court indicated that this served to underline the basic proposition that the question of admissibility and relevance will in each case turn on the nature of the issues arising on the specific facts and the extent to which the particular material in question can assist a jury. Thus, for example, as was the case in Thompson, expert evidence may be relevant if it will assist a jury in the interpretation of conduct that to a ""neuro-typical mind"" may suggest one motive, but in the context of a developmental disorder may appear different. Para 20. The courts rejected the defences proposition that the evidence of a psychologist is admissible to assist the jury on the question of what the applicant or indeed any defendant actually intended, in this case when he made and deployed the explosive device. The courts were of the view that the psychologist’s evidence was restricted – He, the psychologist, cannot give evidence as to what the applicants intention was but only in regard to how his mind might have operated. Where the psychologist was seeking to shed light on the applicant’s intentions (to kill or endanger the lives of others), the court were of the view that he [the psychologist] was not entitled to do so. After rejecting the admissibility of the psychologist’s evidence, the psychologist furnished a subsequent report with a view to addressing some of the concerns raised by the judge. The judge was unwilling to accommodate this additional evidence. The appeal court highlighted the inconsistency between the defence case statement: (1) that the device had been carefully calibrated not to cause harm (a hoax) vs (2) he could not fully understand the consequences of his actions or clearly distinguish he could have caused injury. The appeal court ultimately reached the conclusion that the psychologists evidence was inadmissible as a matter of law and in any event inconsistent with the way the case is being put in the defence statement. It would not serve to elucidate but merely confuse.

","At para 36, the courts clarified the distinction between self-defence and loss of control. Self-defence can arise where a defendant genuinely believes that there will or may be violence directed at himself or another. Loss of control however only arises where there is a fear of serious violence.

","The Crown was directed to review social services files for material of potential relevance in relation to the complainant, but they did not disclose certain information to the defence. The CCRC subsequently unearthed material that should have been disclosed by prosecution to the defence. Para 66. The court concluded: “If the Crown decides to prosecute it must do so fairly. The trial judge and the defence rely on them to do so.” Para 68. “All material that may undermine the prosecution case or assist the defence should be disclosed. Ultimately, it is for the trial judge, not the prosecutor, to decide if the records are admissible.” ","

","With respect to the second ground of appeal advanced by defence, that the evidence submitted by a police officer on gang affiliation did not meet the test for admission as expert evidence and should have been excluded, making reference to R v Myers [2015] UKPC 40 the court judged the evidence submitted by defence was admissible on the basis of: (1) experience: there was a report including a statement that PC had previously worked on the Gangs and Firearms Unit in Newham and that he was employed in the Trident and Area Command. (2) the officer’s actions – reports that he had viewed the images on the appellant's phone. He compared those images to individuals on the Police Aware System and he also had access to the Newham Gangs Matrix and to the Custody Imaging Portal to perform facial recognition of the images. (3) the basis of the officers conclusions on each image - He sets out the image of the phone and the image on the police system so that a comparison could be made and he set out his conclusion on each image, giving details of the individual concerned including dates of birth, police national computer reference and gang affiliation where relevant. He then gave, at least for some individuals, details of their actual gang activity and previous convictions.
Of Myers case law, the courts said: The issue arising in Myers concerns the admissibility of expert evidence when that is put in issue by a party. In the present case, the Crown did not apply to the judge to reopen the prosecution case to permit them to call [the PC]. Instead, the Crown used the information in parts of the report as a basis for cross-examining the appellant on his claim that he did not have connections with gangs. The nub of the complaint therefore is not truly about the admissibility of expert evidence; it is much more about the use to which the contents of such a report can subsequently be put.
","Before explaining how the fingerprint evidence was obtained, the decision made at the trial not to call the expert, the evidence given at trial and the evidence before us in relation to the fingerprint, it is necessary to set out very briefly the nature of fingerprint evidence and the training of fingerprint examiners in England and Wales. The training methods we have described are rigorous; examinations have to be taken and portfolios of work are assessed. Details were provided about the nature of fingerprint evidence. Para 8. The evolution of the evidence; Para 10. The training of fingerprint examiners. With respect to the current case, the stages of identification used by the Nottingham fingerprint bureau prior to the trial were then disclosed. A consultancy providing experts in various forensic disciplines, including fingerprint analysis was consulted. 

There was a level of disagreement about whether one of the fingerprint analysts proposed by the consultancy to the defence could be used based on the qualification of her credentials. After scrutinising and deliberating her credentials the defence opted against using her expertise.

Fingerprint analyst 1, Ms. T – commissioned by defence after being suggested by the consultancy. Employed by the consultancy as a forensic scientist since 1995 (16 years) and a first degree in biological science, other qualifications and instructed in anywhere between 55-65 criminal cases per year. She provided details of her own training experience. She had visited the Police fingerprint Bureau. Ms T’s qualifications were called into question in another CPS area. The police were asked to investigate her qualifications. The consultancy informed the CPS that she was very experienced. It was subsequently averred that she was not qualified as she claimed. Other CPS areas had been critical of her. It was noted that if she provided testimony she would be cross-examined about her shortcomings and about fundamental errors in her report. The challenge to her qualifications were that her training was American and not UK based. The consultancy confirmed that her level of `competence had been challenged in other cases. Ultimately the decision was taken not to rely on her evidence but to rely on Mr. B’s evidence (next)

Fingerprint analyst 2, Mr. B – commissioned by defence also an employee of the consultancy had been working for 7.5 years for the police’s fingerprint bureau. He was the confirming expert. Notably, he had not seen the materials held by the fingerprint bureau. His work had not been validated by another expert since his role was to confirm Ms. T’s opinion.

Fingerprint analyst 3, Mr. M – Manager a police fingerprint bureau. He was commissioned by the prosecution

Fingerprint analyst 4, Mrs. W – employed by the same police fingerprint bureau. She was commissioned by the prosecution.

Fingerprint analyst 5, Mr. G. a fingerprint officer employed by a police force was commissioned by the prosecution. He had more than 21 years of fingerprint experience. Para 20. Where he took no working notes experience, including the absence of a chart, he asserted that “""Such charts have never been produced for analysis or verification purposes. This is bad practice and would have a detrimental effect on the independence of the analysis, comparison and evaluation of the mark.""

He furthered that if a chart had been produced by him, then the two other experts who verified his conclusion would not be able to reach their own independent conclusion.

The court opined, para 67 (iv) that no competent forensic scientist in other areas of forensic science these days would conduct an examination without keeping detailed notes of his examination and the reasons for his conclusions. That universal practice of other forensic scientists was not followed by the Nottinghamshire Fingerprint Bureau. There may be reasons for this, but they were not explained to us.

Ms T. complained that Mr Gore did not provide full and complete disclosure of any part of the fingerprint evidence and concluded that the print on the door did not possess 12 ridge characteristics for matching purposes.

Fingerprint analyst 6, before retiring in 1998, Mr. F had worked as a fingerprint office since 1965 for a police fingerprint bureau. He had since practiced as an independent fingerprint expert. He had no further training other than checking prints as the bureau.

Fingerprint analyst 7. Mr. Swann had qualified as a fingerprint officer in the “traditional way” (detailed in para 11). He was previously in charge of a bureau and had been an adviser to the Home Office. He retired in 1987. He had over 50 years of experience but no on-going training with exception to attending lectures and conference on fingerprinting

The court accepted that Mr. G, Mr. M and Mrs W. had sufficient experience in the examination of fingerprints, were well trained and utilised modern equipment. With respect to their opinions, the three prosecution experts tended to be in agreement. They did not tend to agree with the defence expert.

Para 43. At the second hearing Mr G. produced images of the appellant's prints which had been taken by ""Livescan"" – a method of taking prints by scanning each person who is arrested; such prints were stored on the National Automated Finger Print Identification System (NAFIS). The court was informed that individuals who operate at NAFIS do not permit digital images to be downloaded onto a disk and provided to the court to view on its screens; instead we were provided with a disk of photographs of the digital image which were shown to the courts on their screens along with photographs

","Defence on behalf of the appellant alleged that the complainant deleted individual messages to provide a misleading picture which inculpated their client. It was submitted that the evidence of the full facebook message exchange goes directly to the veracity of both the complainant and the applicant. Jury in the trial were presented with a deleted version of the facebook messages. The unedited version of facebooks presented a different context of events to those advanced by the prosecution on behalf of the complainant ultimately contradicting their case and supporting the applicant's case that he was being truthful and that the act of intercourse was consensual.



","Two cases, including the case of Morgan, were listed together.
","Para 101. the defence expert instructed by the respondents identified various problems with the dataset provided – including the presence of Legal Professional Privilege (LPP – concerning disclosure, the prosecution must explain what it is doing and what it will not be doing at this stage) material and missing or corrupted files. At a subsequent hearing, directions were given for the exchange of expert reports to address the issues identified. The Digital Forensic Group (DFG on behalf of the prosecution) advised that the removal of LPP duplicates meant that e-disclosure would take at least a further nine months. Para 102. the prosecution informed the court that it could not comply with a deadline imposed by them, citing the technical difficulties in relation to 'embedded LPP files' such that none of the product produced for disclosure up until that time could be guaranteed as free of privileged material. Para 103. Bespoken software, to be used on behalf of the prosecution subsequently failed to work. The judge identified various deficiencies with the dataset that DFG had produced using FTK. The most significant of these was that there was no tool to search for and place bookmarks on LPP. Additionally, a large number of files on the original hard drive were not present and emails and their attachments were not appropriately linked. There were also difficulties using FTK (forensic software used by the prosecution) with whole word searches and the failure to display some email addresses in full. The judge expressed the view that this meant that the prosecution had failed to provide disclosure in an acceptable form. Para 111. There was criticism of the ‘Relativity dataset’ particularly of a professional who had been jointly instructed by the respondents. The judge summarised the criticism as being that the CPIA dataset was 'wholly unusable' - that it lacked 'forensic integrity' because the functionality of the search process was compromised, which resulted in wholly inaccurate and perverse results. Para 112. The expert evidence the judge heard focussed on four main topics: i) 'parent/child determination', ii) the inadequacy of the metadata and missing metadata; iii) email threading and iv) duplicate documents. The email threading was only successful for between 60% to 80% of emails. In some instances, exact duplicate items were stored in modified formats, thereby hiding the duplicate nature of the documentation; this was a result of the manner in which the items were exported out of FTK.

","The respondent was due to face trial on an indictment alleging a number of counts of stalking. The judge was faced with an application by the respondent to adjourn on the grounds that significant material had only been served a few days before and required expert analysis which would take three weeks. The prosecution agreed that it was appropriate to adjourn the trial, albeit the trial judge did not agree. He ruled that due to delay on the part of the prosecution, evidence of telephone call data records and telephone cell site data would be excluded which would most probably extinguish the prosecution’s case. As a result, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) applied for leave to appeal the terminating ruling. Para 14. An inference was made based on the distribution map prepared by the analyst of the cell sites utilised by both phones to make calls: this was on the basis that the same cell sites were being used by the two phones in roughly the same proportions. Defence pressed for the trial to be adjourned because their expert had only had the call data in its original format that week of the hearing and had recommended a full sell site survey and there had been no opportunity to take their client through the recent material.","Compile all of these notes into one word document.

","Para 11. Concerns were expressed by counsel for the prosecution about the evidence from the financial analyst expert but this was not reported. On the materials made available to the court they regarded her evidence as being capable of belief. Para 13, the courts expressed the view that the fresh evidence was of a sufficient weight and credibility that a jury should consider it on a retrial.

","Para 13. A psychiatrist treating the complainant gave evidence in court. He was initially instructed as a single joint expert to deal with questions from both the prosecution and defence regarding the: (1) complainant's mental health, (2) the potential impact of her condition upon her behaviour in the course of the incident, and (3) her reliability as a witness. The defence became unwilling to accept his testimony as a single joint expert on the grounds that he was “disinclined to address the issue of the witness's reliability”. In response they instruct their own expert - a psychologist. The psychologist’s was if the opinion that the complainant was an unreliable witness owing to her mental health difficulties. There was a conflict within the expert evidence proffered. Where the experts disagreed on the complainant reliability this was deemed a critical issue for the appeal hearing and the judge referred to case law in order to clarify how to proceed. Para 28. Cannings is best understood as summarised in Archbold 2010 at paragraph 10-67: ""In R v Cannings .... a case of the alleged murder of a baby, it was said that if the outcome of the trial depends exclusively or almost exclusively on a serious disagreement between distinguished and reputable experts, it will often by unwise, and therefore unsafe, to proceed; and this was particularly so, in a field of learning, where the experts were still at the 'frontiers of knowledge'. Cannings is not, however, authority for a proposition, in cases where the issue is whether a child was the victim of a deliberate killing by its mother or had died from natural, even if unexplained, causes, that whenever there is a genuine conflict of opinion between reputable experts, the prosecution should not proceed, or should be stopped, or that the evidence of the prosecution experts should be disregarded; in Cannings, there was nothing to establish unnatural as opposed to natural death and the basis of the case depended on inferences by one group of experts which were disputed by another reasonable body of medical opinion: R v Kai-Whitewind [2005] 2 Cr App R 31, CA.""

","Para 188/189. Upon querying a diagnosis, an expert suggested a further assessment be conducted by a pathologist, which the prosecution latter advanced she should not have persisted with. “She herself had recommended examination by [the pathologist] who in turn rejected the suggestion”. The prosecution furthered that the expert “did not accept that rejection and on that basis her oral evidence, casts significant doubt upon the reliability of the rest of her evidence and her approach to this case. It demonstrates, to our satisfaction, that she was prepared to maintain an unsubstantiated and insupportable theory in an attempt to bolster this appeal”… “The inadequacies of her evidence were compounded by her persistence in the suggestion that [the co-defendant] might have suffered from HIV and not from MS…[the experts] approach to that aspect of the evidence supports our views as to the unreliability of her evidence. Para 190. In the light of our view as to the quality of [the expert] evidence before us we conclude it is not capable of undermining the safety of the verdict. For those reasons, we reject the application to call fresh evidence. Subsequent to hearing the cases of Henderson, Butler and Oladapo, the court some of the general points posited included: 
Para 202. The problem for the courts is how to manage expert evidence so that a jury may be properly directed in a way which will, so far as possible, ensure that any verdict they reach may be justified on a logical basis. Para 203. In Kai-Whitewind Judge LJ rejected the contention that where there is a conflict of opinion between reputable experts, expert evidence called by the Crown is automatically neutralised. He emphasised that it was for the jury to evaluate the expert evidence even where the experts disagree as to the existence of the symptoms upon which their opinions were based. But how is a jury to approach conflicting expert evidence? We suggest it can only do so if that evidence is properly marshalled and controlled before it is presented to the jury. Unless the evidence is properly prepared before the jury is sworn it is unlikely that proper direction can be given as to how the jury should approach that evidence. Thus the jury will be impeded in considering that evidence in a way which will enable them to reach a logically justifiable conclusion. Para 204. It is desirable that any judge hearing cases such as these, which depend entirely on expert evidence, should have experience of the complex issues and understanding of the medical learning. Para 205. Proper and robust pre-trial management is essential. Without it, real medical issues cannot be identified. Absent such identification, a judge is unlikely to be able to prevent experts wandering into unnecessary complicated and confusing detail. Unless the real medical issues are identified in advance, avoidable detail will not be avoided. Para 206. The process of narrowing the real medical issues is also vital in relation to another important function of the judge in advance of the trial. He should be in a position to identify whether the expert evidence which either side wishes to adduce is admissible. This assessment is as difficult as it is important. The test adopted by this court in Harris was described in the judgment of King CJ in R v Bonython [1984] 38 SASR 45: First, whether the subject matter of the opinion falls within the class of subjects upon which the expert testimony is permissible and second, whether the witnesses acquired by study or experience have sufficient knowledge of the subject to render their opinion of value in resolving the issues before the court. Bonython was cited by this court in R v Reid & Ors [2009] EWCA Crim 2698 [111(i)] with the qualification that it is important that the court acknowledges advances to be gained from new techniques and new advances in science. Reid is concerned with DNA evidence but the observations of the court in relation to the admissibility of expert evidence apply with equal force to cases concerning baby shaking as it applied to the developing science of DNA. We shall return to emphasise the importance of Part 33 of the Criminal Procedures Rules 2010 in the context of these cases. We shall say no more about admissibility since the unsatisfactory state of the law has been the subject of the Law Commission Consultation paper No. 190 ""The Admissibility of Expert Evidence in Criminal proceedings in England and Wales"", and is likely to lead to changes in the current approach of laissez-faire, which the Law Commission suggests requires reform (3.14). Para 207. The Kennedy report cautions against doctors using the courtroom to ""fly their personal kites or push a theory from the far end of the medical spectrum"". It recommends a checklist of matters to be established by the trial judge before expert evidence is admitted, including:- 1. Is the proposed expert still in practice? 2. To what extent is he an expert in the subject to which he testifies? 3. When did he last see a case in his own clinical practice? 4. To what extent is his view widely held?"" Para 208. We emphasise the third, which was of importance in these appeals. The fact that an expert is in clinical practice at the time he makes his report is of significance. Clinical practice affords experts the opportunity to maintain and develop their experience. Such experts acquire experience which continues and develops. Their continuing observation, their experience of both the foreseen and unforeseen, the recognised and unrecognised, form a powerful basis for their opinion. Clinicians learn from each case in which they are engaged. Each case makes them think and as their experience develops so does their understanding. Continuing experience gives them the opportunity to adjust previously held opinions, to alter their views. They are best placed to recognise that that which is unknown one day may be acknowledged the next. Para 209 made reference to Part 33 of what are now the Criminal Procedure Rules 2010. Those rules need to be deployed to ensure that the overriding objective to deal with criminal cases justly is achieved (1.1). The rules are designed to ensure that the expert opinion is unbiased (33.2.1) and in particular, by virtue of 33.3(1), that an expert report provides evidence of relevant experience and accreditation (a), details of any literature relied upon (b), that any range of opinion should be summarised and reasons given before the opinion of the expert (f) and that any qualifications to that opinion should be stated (g). Para 210. It will be necessary that the court directs a meeting of experts so that a statement can be prepared of areas of agreement and disagreement (33.6.2(a) and (b)). Such a meeting will not achieve its purpose unless it takes place well in advance of the trial, is attended by all significant experts, including the defence experts, and a careful and detailed minute is prepared, signed by all participants. Usually it will be preferable if others, particularly legal representatives, do not attend. Absent a careful record of the true issues in the case, it is difficult to see how the trial can be properly conducted or the jury properly guided as to the rational route to a conclusion. The court may be required to exercise its important power to exclude evidence from an expert who has not complied with a direction under [33.6(2), 33.6(4)]. The court should bear in mind the need to employ single joint experts where possible (33.7). Para 212. A case management hearing may often present an opportunity for concerns as to previous criticism of an expert and an expert's previous tendency to travel beyond their expertise to be aired. Whilst such history may not be a ground for refusing the admission of the evidence, it may well trigger second thoughts as to the advisability of calling the witness. Para 219. If the issue arises, a jury should be asked to judge whether the expert has, in the course of his evidence, assumed the role of an advocate, influenced by the side whose cause he seeks to advance. If it arises, the jury should be asked to judge whether the witness has gone outside his area of expertise. The jury should examine the basis of the opinion. Can the witness point to a recognised, peer-reviewed, source for the opinion? Is the clinical experience of the witness up-to-date and equal to the experience of others whose evidence he seeks to contradict? Para 221. We acknowledge the danger of being over-prescriptive in relation to directions to the jury. But judges, we suggest, need to remember that their directions are part of the means by which they ensure that a case which depends on expert evidence proceeds to its conclusion on a logically justifiable basis.
","Para 6. Whilst it is now commonly accepted that the triad is strong prima facie evidence of shaking, that depends upon the common acceptance of experts in the field and not upon the conclusion of courts which are only able to weigh the evidence presented before them. Previous legal authority cannot determine whether the conclusion of a medical report should be accepted or rejected. The most legal authority can do is present an accurate record of what was or was not accepted or propounded.

Para 7. We stress this problem because we feared that the medical profession may have looked to the courts to resolve medical controversy. But the difficulty the courts face, in an area of medical controversy, was demonstrated by the course of these appeals…However, renewed controversy in relation to post-mortem findings in cases of traumatic head injury in children led to a meeting at the Royal College of Pathologists on 10 December 2009. The controversy was a matter of concern to the courts as the President, Professor Furness, recognised. At the meeting a number of those recognised to have expertise in the field, who advanced opposing opinions, attended. Certain areas of agreement and disagreement were recorded. But they give rise to two difficulties. Those areas of agreement and disagreement should inform future opinions. It is difficult to see how any expert could advance an opinion to which those conclusions were relevant without at least reference to them.

Para 29. Professor Luthert is a Professor of Pathology and Consultant ophthalmologist at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology. His distinguished career and qualifications were not the subject of any challenge by the prosecution and so it is unnecessary for us to give their detail.

Para 39. Reference was made to a case that was unknown at the time of trial and at the time the reports were prepared for the purposes of the appeal. This served to demonstrate “the limits of knowledge at any given time in the field of medical science. The previously accepted proposition that only trauma can cause retinal folds was shown to be incorrect”.

Para 47. The evidence of any expert in a particular field is inevitably limited to the field in which he professes expertise. That, of course, is why no expert can be in the position of a jury or, for that matter, of this court, able to put particular evidence in the context of the totality.

Para 61 “In our judgment, Dr ‘X’ experience was more historic and far more limited than that of Dr ‘Y’. He has not conducted autopsies or given evidence in cases involved with baby-shaking for many years.”

There were disagreement of opinions between the prosecution and defence medical experts. 

The courts drew a distinction between the expertise of clinical vs pathological findings as well as the experts experience, i.e. Para 42 “But he does not seek to dispute Mr X clinical experience and, indeed, he is in no position to do so since he is a pathologist and not a clinician”

One of the experts also relied on his own research and published literature (Para 49). Additionally, another expert referred to some experimental data supporting a non-traumatic cause as the mechanism for retinal fold formation. This is a reference to correspondence from Dr Gardiner commenting on a paper by Dr Sturm in the American Journal of Ophthalmology of April 2008 (Para 33). There was a disagreement between the defence and prosecution experts with one rejecting the others challenge to an empirical paper on the basis of his clinical observation (Para 34)

One of the experts furnished three reports for this case, the last one being a consolidated report. There was a joint conference between him and another expert from which a document was produced, signed by both (para 29).

It was advanced that the experience of one expert was “more historic and far more limited than that of” another expert and that the latter “has not conducted autopsies or given evidence in cases involved with baby-shaking for many years”…“His lack of experience and his lack of appreciation of the importance of this point leads us to the conclusion that his evidence was fundamentally flawed…We reject his evidence insofar as it fails to attribute significance to that which the beta app staining revealed”\ (Para 61). 

Upon providing expert testimony in the original trial, one expert offered an explanation of their examination before acknowledging that “there were other individuals who took a contrary view but suggested that they tended to be experts not involved in the day-to-day care and management of abused children” (Para 23)","Para 45. The judge making reference to R v Flynn and St John [2008] 2 Cr App R 20 highlighted the “dangers inherent in voice recognition” and outlined general terms the expert evidence before the court demonstrated (1) identification of a suspect by voice recognition is more difficult than visual identification; (2) identification by voice recognition is likely to be more reliable when carried out by experts using acoustic and spectrographic techniques as well as sophisticated auditory techniques, than when made by the lay listener; (3) the ability of a lay listener correctly to identify voices is subject to a number of variables. Additionally, attention was drawn to the paucity of research about the effect of variability
","The medical evidence presented in this case fell under several categories (treating doctors: A & E, the paediatricians and the radiologists where it was highlighted that “The second group of medical evidence related to those experts who were asked to express a view as to causation, although the treating doctors were allowed to do so too”) and three subdivisions (ophthalmology, paediatric neurology and paediatric neuroradiology) (para 89/90). The original trial involved 18 medical witnesses (prosecution had called fifteen medical witnesses and the defendant three). The court presented the experts standings by making reference to their experiences, i.e. “Both these witnesses are of considerable standing in their field of paediatric neuroradiology and both have considerable forensic experience both in the criminal and in the family jurisdictions” (Para 95). There were disagreement of opinions between the prosecution and defence medical experts. We should add this. The summing-up contained serious misdirections. Those misdirections provide cogent support for the conclusion we have reached. The Judge did not sufficiently direct the jury as to the importance of the opthalmological evidence and its effect in undermining the triad as evidence of NAHI and as supporting an unknown cause. It was incumbent upon him to have done so. No proper direction was given to the jury that they must consider the possibility of an unknown cause, particularly in the light of the ophthalmological evidence, and should only convict if they reject it. The summing-up was also defective in its structure. The Judge carefully and conscientiously recited long passages of the expert evidence to the jury. But he did not 'direct' the jury at all. He recited those passages in the chronological order in which the evidence was given. That was of little assistance to the jury. The jury required a careful direction as to the essential issues which they had to determine and a reminder of that evidence and only that evidence which went to those issues. It was necessary to deal with that evidence issue by issue. The Judge did not have the assistance of R v Schmidt [2009] EWHC Crim 838 in which a summing-up similar to that in this case led to the quashing of the conviction [42] and [47]. Nor did he have the assistance of the current Judicial Studies Board Crown Court Bench Book March 2010, Chapter 8. We have only drawn attention to the summing-up because it assists in emphasising the need to construct a summing-up to meet the complexities of cases such as these and to ensure the case proceeds on a logical basis. It is only fair to the Judge to state that throughout the trial and the summing-up the Judge exhibited conspicuous care and fairness. We think that the conviction on Count 4 should be quashed as well. 

","This case consisted of: trial, a hearing in front of the family division of the high court before the appeal court review. Para 22 (iii) the appeal court made reference to opinion evidence from two doctors not being accepted at a previous family high court hearing. Para 33. It was indicated that the expert proffering an opinion on battered women’s syndrome had been dismissed in the judges judgement with the judge concluding: ""I am convinced that the mother has further tailored and altered her account in order to run a case in front of the jury that she thought was going to be more successful than the one before me.""






","Para 9. (2) The Court of Appeal shall, in considering whether to receive any evidence, have regard in particular to –  (a) whether the evidence appears to the Court to be capable of belief;  (b) whether it appears to the Court that the evidence may afford any ground for allowing the appeal; (c) whether the evidence would have been admissible in the proceedings from which the appeal lies on an issue which is the subject of the appeal; and (d) whether there is a reasonable explanation for the failure to adduce the evidence in those proceedings."" Para 11 on the issue of an appellant seeking to call fresh evidence the testimony of an expert: It is not unknown for appellants to seek to call on appeal the testimony of an expert other than one who gave evidence at trial. Such evidence may not have been available at the trial, particularly in cases in which scientific knowledge has progressed since the trial. In some cases, however, an appellant seeks to call as fresh evidence the testimony of an expert who could have given evidence at his trial. The Court will not readily allow such evidence to be adduced. The applicable principles were explained by Moses LJ in Martin T [2008] EWCA Crim 3229: ""33 The second observation we make relates to the expert evidence and relates to the importance of recognising that the criminal justice system does not allow two trials, first by a jury with one team of lawyers and secondly, possibly years later in the Court of Appeal, by a second who have managed to find an expert who would have said something different had that expert been called at the trial. The time to deploy expert assistance is at trial and not later. Of course there will be cases where the Court of Appeal will out of justice admit and rely upon evidence which might have been obtained at trial but was not, when that evidence falsifies and destroys the basis on which the earlier conviction was obtained. Justice may demand no less and many serious injustices by that means have been cured in the past, all the more so where scientific research and thought has developed. But that fresh evidence must have the impact which the statutory jurisdiction of this court dictates. It must be such as to undermine the safety of the verdict. It is not sufficient that it merely demonstrates that the original evidence from experts might have been assessed in a different way or a different conclusion on the expert evidence part of the case might have been reached unless it strikes at the fundamental basis upon which the verdict rested."" Para 41. In deciding whether the application to adduce fresh evidence should be permitted the court considered whether the evidence appeared to be capable of belief. The court subsequently rejected that the evidence was incapable of belief. Para 46/62. It was noted that one of the defence experts had been instructed for the trial, produced a report for the trial and present at the trial. Therefore, he could have contradicted the evidence advanced by prosecution, but did not do so. Para 46/67. The court also judged that his expert’s evidence should be “considered with caution” because, although he had signed a confidentiality agreement in another legal case (the court later adverted that there was evidence that he had broken the agreement signed in this case) he had refused to sign the agreement for the current case. Moreover, the expert had reported been convicted of perjury by misrepresenting his qualifications when giving evidence. 
","
Para 11. The second trial lasted much longer than the first, not just because it was necessary to call the new scientific evidence, but because in the meantime Parliament had passed the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which rendered evidence of bad character admissible in circumstances in which it had previously not been. Para 12. The lapse of time between the murder and the second trial had led to other unfortunate consequences. Two exhibits of prime importance, the jacket worn by the appellant on the day in question and the murder weapon itself, had been lost. It was therefore not possible for the experts instructed by the defence to examine those articles or to obtain any DNA samples from the knife for analysis. The passage of time between since the offence and, now second hearing, rendered the recollections of important witnesses unreliable. Between the time of the crime and the second trial two exhibits of “prime importance” were lost. It was noted in Para 12 that it was therefore not possible for the experts instructed by the defence to examine those articles or to obtain any DNA samples from the knife for analysis. At the first trial the conviction was quashed.

","This was the appellants second appeal against conviction it was brought by the Criminal Cases Review Commission in light of fresh DNA evidence which was not obtained at the time of the trial. Defence also advanced a ground of appeal, asking the court to receive fresh psychiatric evidence about a prosecution witness. This appeal case comes 14 years after the index offence was committed. According to para 55 the prosecution had given disclosure to the defence of reports from a psychiatrist and psychologist on a witness who provided evidence against the appellant. The material in the psychiatrist’s report was used by defence in their cross examination to show that the witness lacked credibility and that he was “inconsistent and inherently unlikely."" Para 13. The case against the appellant comprised evidence of four kinds – circumstantial evidence, forensic evidence, lies and admissions. At the original trial there was no DNA evidence to connect either defendant with the cigarette ends found at the crime scene. Para 35 since the trial there have been advances in scientific techniques. There is no fresh evidence about the cigarette end found in the glass of water in the hall, because any DNA traces would have been washed away, but there is now DNA evidence about the other cigarette ends found at the sisters' house. Despite the fresh DNA evidence, the appellant court did not consider the appellant's convictions to be unsafe and the appeal was therefore dismissed

","Para 102. In regards to the Criminal appeals act (1968) and the admission on fresh evidence the courts commented that 'expert shopping' was always to be discouraged and although public funds should always be available to instruct suitable experts when defending a criminal prosecution, it is less clear whether such funds should continue to be expended in seeking further expert evidence (in the hope of finding someone to say something different) after conviction. Thus, in this case, four experts were instructed at the time of the trial; at least six experts (five of whom were new to the case) have provided further evidence for the Applicant's present advisers, of whom two have been called. On the other hand, if fresh credible expert evidence has, in fact, been obtained which does provide a real argument as to the safety of a conviction, it is almost inconceivable that the court should not fully consider that evidence and its implications, not least to avoid the risk of what would be a miscarriage of justice. Ultimately, the court will evaluate the material placed before it. At para 94, the courts highlighted a “valid point” made by one of the medical experts:    ""[T]here is a huge difference in the legal approach to a problem and the medical one. The lawyer always takes each component of a problem and then tries to beat it to death. Could this happen in other circumstances? Yes. But the doctor does exactly the opposite. They take the components of the problem and they try and assemble it into a plausible whole. That is where the difference is."" At para 95 the courts discussed the principles set out in the criminal appeal 1968 statute for admitting fresh evidence and president case laws.","Para 1. This was not a conventional case for review for the appellant court. The case was referred by the Criminal Cases Review Commission because they harboured concerns about the standing of one of the pathologists who gave evidence at the original trial. The expert subsequently faced a disciplinary hearing charged in relation to his reports in two cases. At the disciplinary hearing he was found to have given unreliable and over-dogmatic evidence as a forensic pathologist in both those cases. The tribunal found that he had unreasonably deduced conclusions from evidence, either at post mortem or at the scene of the death, which whilst it could support his conclusions did not enable other possibilities to be excluded. He had persisted in his conclusions without any proper regard for the contrary and reasoned opinions of several other pathologists. The tribunal tellingly described his evidence in one of the case as: ""…vigorously advancing forensic pathological conclusions based on an unacceptable level of speculation without evidential foundation and demonstrating a degree of inflexibility when confronted with reasoned contrary opinions by colleagues which might be dangerous to the objective presentation of expert testimony."" It was further posited by the appeal courts that the pathologist had also been found to have been at fault in the conduct of both post mortems, because he had not preserved samples for subsequent histological analysis if necessary; that failure had had the effect of hampering subsequent checks on the accuracy of his conclusions. The complaint was not of lack of honesty or integrity, but the findings mean that his reliability on those occasions examined fell well short of what has to be expected of any expert witness, and specifically of a Home Office Approved Pathologist. Ultimately, that particular court has had to consider the consequences of deficiencies on the part of the expert in 4 cases.


","Para 4. The SGM+ process yielded a major and minor profile from the DNA sample. The minor profile obtained was compared with DNA on the national database. There were three possible matches: two were eliminated and the third was the appellant. 
Para 5. The sample from the appellant as referenced on the database was then upgraded and subjected to the SGM+ process. This was then compared with the minor profile obtained from the vaginal swab of the victim. It was said that there was a sufficient profile obtained from the partial profile at a sufficient number of loci to provide a match probability in the region of 1 in 100,000. Para 6. The sample from the appellant was then subjected to LCN (LCN, Low copy number DNA) process. The minor profile was said by the FSS expert to show a match probability of 1 in over 3 million. After the analysis of the further swab taken from the victim and an analysis made combining the SGM+ and LCN results, a match probability of the minor profile to that of the appellant was 1 in over 50 million. In response to there being a disagreement between two experts, one appointed by the prosecution the other commissioned by the appellant, a meeting between the experts was convened. Despite further meetings taking place between the experts, the disagreements remained. There were further points as to the number of alleles that could properly be taken into account on the profiles obtained by the LCN process. Key arguments were advance by the defence (Para 13) and prosecution (Para 14) in relation to the quantity of DNA sample used as follows: Para 13. It was put to the judge that the amount of the minor profile was 50 picograms, the profile was inadmissible because it was below the stochastic threshold of 100-200 picograms. It was contended that the threshold set out in Reed & Reed applied to the profile of the minor contributor and not to the whole of the DNA analysed; as it was below 100-200 picograms it was ipso facto inadmissible. Para 14. The Crown contended that this was a misreading of Reed & Reed; the court had said that where quantities were below the stochastic threshold, it was the reliability of the profile that determined admissibility. There was no lower limit. Para 23. Issue 1: Was the DNA evidence admissible? Conclusion of the court for issue 1: It is reliability that is the issue, not the quantity, though plainly the quantity is relevant (as has been made clear) to the consideration of stochastic effects. Para 28. Issue 2: Should the judge have made the order for a preparatory hearing? Should he in any event have made it after he had given his ruling? (1) Should the judge have ordered a preparatory hearing? Adducing section 29(2)(a) the judge said “it was difficult to think of anything more material to the jury's determinations and findings than ""this highly complex forensic scientific evidence based, as it is, upon biochemistry, something which neither the court nor jurors may be expected to be experts in.” Reference made to the Criminal Procedure & Investigations Act (CPIA) (2) Should the judge have ordered the hearing ex post facto? Para 37. the whole hearing has to be far more sharply focussed than this hearing was. Issue 3: What procedure should have been followed in the light of the objection to admissibility raised by the appellant?","The Court of Appeal received fresh evidence which described a change in approach by the Forensic Science Service to its guidelines on ""the assessment, interpretation, and reporting of firearms chemistry cases"". Low level of residue from firearm – not significant but it dependence upon the precise circumstances and other evidence
Para 21. Given the 4 week period between the killing and the recovery of the exhibits, and the lack of knowledge about wear, it was not possible to know for what period the particle had been present. Para 22. Understanding that the evidence was that the armed officers had searched the Mitsubishi, she (defence expert) expressed the view that contamination was a possibility. However, the evidence was to the contrary; the armed officers had not searched the Mitsubishi (vehicle associated with crime). The defence expert later conceded upon cross-examination that, under the circumstances presented by the prosecution counsel, that it was ""highly unlikely"" that contamination had taken place. Direction on Good character: Para 29. the appropriate terms of a good character direction in favour of the applicant. The applicant had no previous convictions. Ordinarily he would have been entitled to receive from the trial judge a direction to the effect that the jury should take the applicant's good character into account in his favour in two respects: first, a defendant of good character may be less likely to commit offences, certainly offences of the gravity alleged, and second, a man of good character may be more likely to tell the truth about important matters. Para 30. a person is of good character does not mean that he is incapable of committing crimes, however serious. If that were so, no-one would ever be convicted because we all start with a good character

","Para 33. The appeal court raised some concerns as to the admissibility of the evidence from the two psychologists proferring an opinion on the operation of the human memory and the plausibility of what one of the alleged victims said in one of her statements. In his summing-up the judge reminded the jury of it but observed that it seemed to him that the two experts were agreed eventually that the existence of three versions of events was ""unusual"" but they were by no means saying it could not happen.


","With respect to the third ground of appeal (para 15) – the trial judge’s refusal to admit expert evidence on behalf of defence. The appeal court sought to an explanation from the defence as to how the expert’s evidence would be admissible before positing that there was “no issue as to the expertise” of the expert being knowledgeable of the appellants culture. Counsel for defence furthered that the expert evidence could help the jury to understand why she might have lied in her first statements when giving her account of the quality of her marriage in the lead up to the offence. In response the judge referred in his Lucas direction to the fact that cultural background may provide an ""innocent"" explanation for lies. Mrs Hollis submitted that the evidence could explain why the appellant gave a no comment interview when arrested, a fact which led to a standard adverse inference direction. Thirdly, so it was submitted, it could explain why in the defence statement no reference was made to sexual abuse by her husband, to which she was to refer in evidence. Defence submitted that the expert was able to give reasons why a Muslim woman of her background might lie rather than dishonour her family. The crown contended that a number of witnesses from her background (i.e. family, first husband and friends) and that the evidence of the proposed expert was irrelevant. The crown concluded that assessment of the reasons for the appellant's lies and omissions did not require any expert assistance. The judge agreed.","Compile all of these notes into one word document.

","Expert 4, whose opinion constituted fresh medical evidence on behalf of the defence partially disagreement with the opinions previously put forwards by the prosecution medical experts. Where the examination of the complainant was 12 years ago, at the time of the appeal hearing, expert 4 posited that: considerably more information is available now to guide interpretation of genital findings than was available in 1997 and this information was based on an extensive evidence based review of the published literature. It clarifies that many findings previously considered diagnostic or suggestive of sexual abuse are non-specific (they occur equally often in children carefully screened for non-abuse)."" 

In light of the more developed state of medical knowledge in this area. The overall conclusion today is radically different from that which he gave at the trial because of the development of medical knowledge and, in particular, the more extensive research base now available to experts in this field.


","At para 27, the appeal court expressed content that the new expert evidence, whilst adding detail and some fresh assessment to the expert evidence available at trial, would in the end not assist the defendant in contesting this charge and that it would not have been in her best interests to adduce it, nor would it be now. In those circumstances the appeal court submitted that it was not either necessary or expedient in the interests of justice to admit the evidence. To this end, they furthered that the interests of justice lie in there being a single trial at which the defendant and the Crown each presents the whole of its case. The court concluded that it would be apt to subvert the process of justice if it is open to a defendant to rely on appeal on something which could have been relied upon at trial, but which he chose not to adduce.","Compile all of these notes into one word document.

","This case concerned what whether the appellant was suffering from an abnormality of mind. Can Alcohol dependency syndrome constitute an abnormality of mind? This was a central question in this case and a point of contention between the psychiatrists representing either of the legal counsel. According to the prosecution psychiatrist unless the consumption of drink is involuntary (not within ones control) the individual always has a choice and therefore alcohol consumption is not involuntary. The psychiatrist subsequently modified this opinion asserting that he had never encountered someone who did not have a choice but accepted that if a person's drinking was involuntary then it could constitute an abnormality of mind and that he had never seen a case where it was absolutely impossible to resist. Conversely, the opinion of the psychiatrist for defence submitted that the appellant’s level of alcoholism involved an overpowering desire to drink. His drinking was involuntary. It was an abnormality of mind which impaired the applicant's responsibility for the killing. There are different views on this within the medical profession. The courts acknowledged at para 6: Section 2 of the Homicide Act 1957 as currently framed and stripped to its essentials comprises: (1), a disease inducing, (2) an abnormality of mind and (3) substantial impairment of responsibility. The language unfortunately does not accord with that used by psychiatrists and the third element seems to invite a ethical value judgment. The whole section was famously described by Buxton LJ as ""disastrous and beyond redemption"". It is soon to be replaced by section 52 of the Coroners and Justice Act At Para 7 the court commented: In the present context it is important to distinguish two further problems that have arisen, one being a problem of law and the other being a problem of medical science. The legal difficulty was that some judges had told jurors that as a matter of law the defendant could not suffer a relevant abnormality of mind and so benefit from substantial impairment if the defendant at any time had freely chosen to drink. At para 8: Given the shifting frontiers of medical science that might demonstrate a closed and unscientific mind. However, on close inspection of the evidence here it is plain that [the crown psychiatrist] had initially put forward such an extreme opinion he later qualified it by accepting the medical possibility of an irresistible impulse to drink through ADS, noting, however, his opinion that he had not in his experience and assessment encountered such a case.

","The present case involves ‘double jeopardy’ with calls for the respondent to be retried for an offence committed more than a decade later after circumstantial evidence (blood stains) were found, which were not detected during the original investigation. Murder committed 12th August 1995. Suspect arrested 13th September 1995 – with items seized. In 1995 an item of clothing (boot) from the suspect was examined by the Forensic Science Service aided with light from a fluorescent tube and an ordinary domestic light bulb. The examination was conducted with both the naked eye and a microscope. After carrying out a Kastle-Meyer test on the boot to indicate the presence of blood – the test was negative. On the 1st of February 1996 the respondent was charged with the murder of the deceased. The suspect was acquitted in December 1996. The case was re-opened and re-investigated ten years later 2009 subsequent to the acquittal being quashed and an order for the respondent to be re-tried. In light of the discovery of the evidence that was missed, the court of appeal raised three issues: (i) Was the evidence new? (ii) Was the evidence compelling? (iii) Was a re-trial in the interests of justice? The boot was first examined for blood stains in 1995, 1996 and 2008. The forensic scientist/s used KM (or similar tests) to examine the boot for traces of blood. They highlighted the difficulties of the examination owing to the dark colour of the boot, the uneven surface and the process of examining it under a microscope itself. These difficulties (para 37 i) were cited as reasons why a ‘competent examiner’ may not have found visible traces of blood.The court was also expressed concern that in using  ‘angle-poise lamp with an ordinary domestic light bulb’ to examine the boot originally, the Forensic Science Service laboratory was not sufficiently equip with more powerful lighting (i.e. halogen). The court also acknowledges that the microscope used in 1995 was less flexible in comparison to those used in 2008. The court acknowledged the difficulty in detecting the blood on the boot ant that it was “possible for competent scientists to miss blood”. However, the court mentioned that following examinations of the boot in 1995 and 1996 the boot was not re-checked on completion by the scientists. The court also indicated that there were four areas on the boot where blood had not been detected during the initial examination. In reaching a decision on whether it was in the best interests of justice to have a retrial the court considered: The memory of witnesses: the risk of cross-contamination of their recollection, the dimming of memories over a 15 year period; The destruction of the transcripts from the original trial; Some witnesses had since died; Original exhibits, that could be used as evidence had since been destroyed (i.e. the clothing seized from the respondent for examination had since been returned to him); The court later described a “failure of due diligence in the examination of the boots”; The delays in the investigation; Para 59. The fallibility of scientific investigation: there was insufficient understanding of the fallibility of testing for blood and the necessity of a second and thorough check.The court concluded “we are satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that the acquittal be quashed and there be a re-trial”


","Para 19. It has been rightly submitted by Mr Burn that this court should only interfere with a decision of a judge whether to admit evidence of bad character if satisfied that the judge was plainly wrong. In this case in our judgment he was. It is unfortunate that he was not invited to and did not reconsider whether the reasoning in his original ruling could rarely be applied in the case of a single past offence committed by a 14-year old.

Disagreement 1. Making reference to internet Protocol (IP) address/es One of the computer experts, for defence, advanced the possibility that the appellant “Did not Visit” a particular website. However, the Prosecution computer expert counter contended that IP addresses normally change when a user logs off the internet. Disagreement 2. The prosecution computer expert proffered that while it was possible for an Internet user to disguise his IP address, it was not possible for him to assume the IP address allocated to someone else, specifically another proxy server.",99,99,,99,"The disagreements were as follows: 1. Whether the quantity of the minor profile was such that stochastic variations had been sufficiently taken into account. 2.  Whether there were more than two contributors. 3.  Whether the way in which the process of analysis carried out had properly followed the applicable protocols. 4.  Whether the samples had been handled, stored and recorded correctly. 5.

Para 35 the expert could not comment on the fact that the spots of blood found on the wall were of similar size to those found on the appellant's jacket, whereas he had actually said that he did not think that there was anything significant in it. It is furthered that according to the judge, the expert had agreed that he was speaking purely as a scientist, therefore was not concerned with other circumstantial evidence and that therefore comparisons between the size of the blood spots on the jacket and the size of the blood spots on the wall were of no interest to him. Since he had no evidence whether the spots were created and deposited at the same time, he did not need to take into account what was found on the wall.

Q90b. Para 5. It was said that there was a sufficient profile obtained from the partial profile at a sufficient number of loci to provide a match probability in the region of 1 in 100,000. Para 6. The minor profile was said by the FSS expert to show a match probability of 1 in over 3 million. After the analysis of the further swab taken from the victim and an analysis made combining the SGM+ and LCN results, a match probability of the minor profile to that of the appellant was 1 in over 50 million. Para 8. ""The [FSS]'s DNA Interpretation model takes into account the possibility of stochastic variation, therefore in SGM+ and LCN analysis one would make an assessment of the quality of the electrophoretogram and reproducibility of the results. In my opinion stochastic variations are not an important issue in this case as aliquots from the same DNA extract have been run 6 times, the results were highly reproducible and showed no significant stochastic variation. In my opinion, these observations give a more reliable indicator of whether stochastic variation has occurred rather than the Quant value.""

There is therefore a clear inference that he was therefore in the car at the time of the crash due to the very fact the DNA was on the airbag deployed in the crash. The jury are more than entitled to place that evidence in the context of the rest of the evidence in the case. The driver's door was jammed shut, and the front seat was pushed forward. So anyone in the back seat would most likely climb to the side of the car rather than the centre, and therefore away from the airbag. That will be a matter for the jury to consider. There are also entitled to consider that there is no evidence from the defendant to account for finding of his DNA, at least not at this stage, I make clear, because it may well be [referring to Counsel for the applicant] you wish to take instructions. I remind myself of course the provisions in R v Galbraith, and I conclude that a reasonable jury properly directed could properly convict on the evidence.""",99,99,99,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,99,99,,99,99,,99,99,,,99,99,99,99,99,,99,99,,,,,,,,,,,,,,99,99,,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,"Para 33 (vii) ‘At the appellant's trial, the prosecution case was that there were not and could not have been fraudulent transactions on the Landslide computer. The judge summed up to the jury to this effect.’",Para 35. The judge was criticised for telling the jury that one of the experts could not pass comment on the spots of blood found on the wall being of similar size to those found on the appellant's jacket,"As to the significance of the Halifax envelope and the cigarette ends in relation to the appellant, the judge in his summing up said as follows: You are entitled to ask, members of the jury, whether the combined effect of the evidence connecting co-defendant with 364, the connection between 364 and – and the connection between 364 and 20 provided by the false teeth (from one of the victims), and the connection between the two defendants help you to assess the significance as against the [appellant] of the cigarette ends from 364 and his prints on the envelope.",,99,Para 11. No jury was empanelled,99,99,,99,,,99,,99,,,99,"It seems to me that this obviously intelligent jury is unlikely to miss the man in black on the CCTV. It is in evidence anyway. It is not satisfactory simply to leave it, and pretend, as it were, that the man in black is not there. It is, as it seems to me, in the interests of justice, viewing it in the round, that the nettle is grasped. That means that the [defence attorney] may be permitted to cross-examine upon the man in black. He may comment upon what can be seen. If, of course, he makes bad points, they will soon be apparent to this, as I say obviously intelligent jury",99,"The judge ought to have directed the jury that if the expert was wrong in her conclusion about the DNA profiles, then on the only evidence before the court at the trial, the DNA evidence must be disregarded. The judge having failed to do so, the jury may well have embarked upon a task of evaluation for which they were not equipped.",99,99,"The judge was entirely satisfied that there is no fresh evidence in this case. We heard the evidence to determine for ourselves whether that was so. If there had been fresh evidence or we had been concerned the judge stated he would have admitted it, even though it might have been discoverable by due diligence because the interests of justice would have so demanded. But there was none. The judge concluded that there was a strong case against this appellant. The evidence of the doctor was cogent. It strongly supported that of the complainant. The DNA evidence in this case might be described as a makeweight which proved conclusively that the jury were right in the verdict that they reached and this verdict was entirely safe. This appellant was rightly convicted of a gross breach of trust in his serious sexual assault ",,99,The original case proceeded to trial without any forensic evidence of blood on the boots or on any other items of the respondent's clothing which had also been examined,"Para 8. In his summing up the judge dealt with the evidence about the prints in this way: ""As far as the fingerprint he was is concerned, the fingerprint that was on the base of the pyramid amplifier was the defendant's right ring finger. That, you may have come to the conclusion, could not have possibly have been placed there in the course of the burglary because the two items were screwed together. The other print was the defendant's left palm print but was on top of the amplifier by the P of pyramid, and the left thumb impression was somewhere on the white plastic carrier bag from which was recovered the remote control and other small items taken in the burglary. As you know, members of the Jury, fingerprints cannot be dated.""",99,99
