that	O
the	O
crime	O
took	O
place	O
when	O
he	B-defendant_gender

on	O

were	O
aggravating	O
factors	O
which	O
justified	O
characterising	O
the	O

as	O
a	O

and	O
placing	O

evident	O
that	O

available	O
to	O
the	O
defence	O

he	B-defendant_gender

There	O
were	O

if	O

that	O
it	O

important	O
to	O
explore	O
the	O
accuracy	O
of	O
the	O
timings	O

then	O
in	O
our	O

no	O

for	O
the	O
failure	O

anything	O

to	O
Mr	O

'	O

,	O
relied	O
upon	O
as	O
we	O
have	O

that	O

as	O
we	O

it	O
the	O

that	O

not	O

the	O

too	O

for	O

a	O

We	O
turn	O
finally	O
in	O
this	O
regard	O
to	O
the	O
statement	O
which	O
was	O
taken	O
in	O
2016	O
from	O
Babar	O
Qayyum	O
.	O
Given	O
that	O
Qayyum	O
was	O
arrested	O
,	O
and	O
given	O
the	O
terms	O
in	O
which	O
he	B-defendant_gender
was	O
interviewed	O
and	O
the	O
information	O
stored	O
on	O
his	O
phone	O
,	O
an	O
issue	O
would	O
no	O
doubt	O
arise	O
as	O
to	O
his	O
credibility	O
if	O
he	B-defendant_gender
were	O
ever	O
to	O
give	O
evidence	O
.	O
An	O
issue	O
would	O
also	O
arise	O
in	O
our	O
view	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
submission	O
that	O
the	O
statement	O
taken	O
in	O
2016	O
could	O
successfully	O
be	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
an	O
application	O
to	O
adduce	O
hearsay	O
evidence	O
pursuant	O
to	O
section	O
116	O
of	O
the	O
Criminal	O
Justice	O
Act	O
2003	O
.	O
Most	O
importantly	O
,	O
the	O
statement	O
taken	O
from	O
Mr	O
Qayyum	O
does	O
not	O
in	O
our	O
view	O
actually	O
support	O
the	O
applicant	O
'	O
s	O
case	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
which	O
is	O
suggested	O
.	O
A	O
key	O
feature	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
that	O
Mr	O
Qayyum	O
does	O
not	O
say	O
that	O
he	B-defendant_gender
was	O
asked	O
about	O
a	O
relevant	O
topic	O
in	O
interview	O
but	O
can	O
find	O
no	O
record	O
of	O
that	O
topic	O
in	O
the	O
transcript	O
which	O
is	O
now	O
said	O
to	O
be	O
unreliable	O
.	O
On	O
the	O
contrary	O
,	O
he	B-defendant_gender
specifically	O
says	O
that	O
he	B-defendant_gender
does	O
not	O
recall	O
the	O
police	O
officers	O
asking	O
him	O
either	O
about	O
the	O
applicant	O
or	O
about	O
the	O
596	O
number	O
in	O
the	O
context	O
of	O
the	O
importation	O
of	O
drugs	O
into	O
the	O
United	O
Kingdom	O
.	O
He	O
was	O
asked	O
about	O
a	O
phone	O
number	O
ending	O
595	O
.	O
The	O
reason	O
for	O
that	O
is	O
that	O
595	O
was	O
a	O
number	O
stored	O
in	O
his	O
phone	O
as	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
contacts	O
,	O
but	O
596	O
was	O
not	O
stored	O
in	O
his	O
phone	O
.	O

The	O
apparent	O
discrepancy	O
between	O
the	O
stated	O
duration	O
of	O
the	O
interview	O
and	O
the	O
tape	O
counter	O
times	O
is	O
a	O
matter	O
to	O
which	O
we	O
have	O
given	O
careful	O
thought	O
.	O
We	O
note	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
start	O
and	O
finish	O
times	O
of	O
the	O
recorded	O
interview	O
were	O
clearly	O
stated	O
by	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
officers	O
and	O
faithfully	O
transcribed	O
.	O
The	O
proposition	O
therefore	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
that	O
someone	O
has	O
edited	O
the	O
recording	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
way	O
as	O
to	O
remove	O
23	O
minutes	O
from	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
leave	O
the	O
record	O
in	O
terms	O
which	O
make	O
it	O
perfectly	O
plain	O
that	O
the	O
total	O
duration	O
of	O
the	O
interview	O
was	O
90	O
minutes	O
.	O
If	O
that	O
were	O
thought	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
point	O
of	O
importance	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
there	O
to	O
be	O
explored	O
at	O
trial	O
.	O
The	O
discrepancy	O
to	O
which	O
Mr	O
Schofield	O
draws	O
attention	O
is	O
there	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
on	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
the	O
papers	O
.	O
As	O
to	O
why	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
explored	O
in	O
trial	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
submitted	O
on	O
behalf	O
of	O
the	O
applicant	O
that	O
the	O
explanation	O
lies	O
in	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
Qayyum	O
had	O
not	O
at	O
that	O
stage	O
provided	O
his	O
statement	O
later	O
taken	O
in	O
2016	O
.	O
But	O
that	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
respect	O
to	O
the	O
submission	O
,	O
does	O
not	O
seem	O
to	O
us	O
to	O
explain	O
the	O
matter	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
because	O
as	O
we	O
have	O
noted	O
Qayyum	O
says	O
nothing	O
to	O
suggest	O
that	O
he	B-defendant_gender
was	O
in	O
fact	O
questioned	O
about	O
the	O
596	O
phone	O
or	O
about	O
this	O
applicant	O
.	O
More	O
generally	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
us	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
satisfactory	O
explanation	O
for	O
the	O
very	O
late	O
emergence	O
of	O
this	O
point	O
now	O
said	O
to	O
lie	O
at	O
the	O
very	O
heart	O
of	O
the	O
applicant	O
'	O

Mr	O
Schofield	O
submits	O
that	O
all	O
speculation	O
could	O
be	O
ended	O
by	O
the	O
court	O
causing	O
the	O
enquiry	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
which	O
he	B-defendant_gender

We	O
however	O

submission	O
that	O
